            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Religion to be laudable, and having a moſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate opinion of the truth of that Religion, in which they were from the firſt vſe of reaſon bred vp, and which bringeth many temporall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities vnto them; they ſtand ſo hotly to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning thereof that theyr paſſionate affection quite putteth out that clear eye ſight of reaſon: Whence it cometh to paſſe that, when the Truth, is no leſſe clearly ſet before the eyes of theyr vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, then the brighteſt Sunne-ſhine is ſet before our corporall eyes, they are not in caſe to behould it, though me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mean capacity would moſt evidently ſee it, when they have layd a ſide all paſſion, and prejudice, and with a calme and humble mind begged of Allmighty God grace to imbrace that ſincerly, which vpon diligent ſearch, they ſhould vnderſtand to be truth. He who thus ſeeketh, ſhall not faile to find.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I know the multitude of Controverſies which have been rayſed this laſt age, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold difficulties with which they are now grown to be intangled, do make the Search of Truth ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me an impoſſibility to the ignorant, and overwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariſome to the moſt ſtrong and ſtrugling Witts: Therefore no Bookes ſeeme now more neceſſary then ſuch Treatiſes which handle the maine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Queſtions, vpon which all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar queſtions ſo wholy depend, that the true ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it doth neceſſarily draw with it the ſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:62436:7"/>
of all other controverſies which are or can be. This Queſtion of Queſtions is, whether God, out of his moſt ſincere deſire to bring all Soules to that happy eternity for which only he created the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not left vs ſome Iudge vpon earth to end all our, otherwiſe endles, controverſies? And who this Iudge is For the incomparably greater part of thoſe Soules, for which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſhedde his moſt pretious bloud, beeing vnlearned, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had been defective, if the meanes of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing controverſies in points neceſſary to ſalvation, had been ſo hard to be applyed that it had been out of the vulgar reach. It beſeemed therefore the Divine Providence to leave vs ſuch meanes as ſhould be both eaſy for all men to vſe (that ſo all men might, by the vſe of them, come to the end which God ſo earneſtly deſireth) and ſhould alſo be moſt ſufficient for our ſafe direction. For, to provide vs of eaſy meanes, which had been vnſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to direct vs ſecurely, had not been to his, or our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Wee muſt ſay then, that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided vs both of meanes ſufficient to bring vs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely to the knowledge of that Truth, which is neceſſary for the Salvation of our ſoules, and wee muſt ſay alſo, that this meanes is ſufficiently eaſy to be duely vſed, and applied by the farre greater part of the world, conſiſting of vnlearned people. For if it were not ſufficiently eaſy to them to apply
<pb facs="tcp:62436:8"/>
it duly, ſo as by it to atteyne to that true belief, <hi>Without which it is impoſsible to pleaſe God</hi> (11. <hi>Hebr:</hi> 6.) It would alſo be vnprofitable vnto that end for which God did give it them. This is moſt agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reaſon and alſo to thoſe moſt comfortable words of Scripture (<hi>Eſay.</hi> 35.) <hi>Say to the faint har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted take courage and fear not. Behould God himſelfe will come and will ſave you. Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened and the eares of the deaf. And there ſhall be a path and a way, and it ſhall be called the Holy Way. And this ſhall be vnto you a direct way, ſo that fooles cannot erre by it.</hi> Theſe words muſt be made good, and therefore ſuch a way muſt be given vnto vs. And it muſt not only be a Way direct in it ſelfe, but alſo it muſt be <hi>vnto vs a direct Way,</hi> and that ſo direct <hi>that even fooles cannot</hi> (except Wilfully) <hi>erre by it.</hi> This way was promiſed to be given vs, as it is there ſayd <hi>when God himſelfe ſhould come and ſave vs;</hi> and provide better for our Salvation then he had done for thoſe of either the Law of Nature, or Iewiſh Law. Our labour muſt be to find out this Way. And this muſt not be hard even to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For it had been to ſmall purpoſe to provide ſome where, in this vaſt world, a Way, ſo direct for the guidance of the ignorant, without the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes, to be put in this way, were alſo ſufficiently eaſy, even vnto them as ignorant as they are. See my ſecond Section, alſo the 3. 4. 5. 6.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I intend then (by the grace of God) in
<pb facs="tcp:62436:8"/>
this Treatiſe to ſhew that this Way may be eaſily found out, by only ſatisfying ourſelves in the true Reſolution of this Queſtion of Queſtions, leading vs to know aſſuredly <hi>Who is to be our Iudge in all our Controverſies appointed to be ſo by God Himſelf?</hi> For when wee have once found him, all Controverſies ceaſe of what queſtions ſo ever; for without all Controverſy wee muſt follow this Iudge appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to no other end, then to make an end of all our Controverſies by his cleere ſentence; Whence <hi>D. Ferne</hi> in his 27. Section: <hi>Indeed ſuch a Iudge or Vmpire of Chriſtendome would (if to be had) be a ready meanes to compoſe all differences and reſtore truth and peace.</hi> Wee will then indeavour to ſhew that ſuch a Iudge is to be had: And our prime care ſhall be to proceed ſo clearly, that a man, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacity, may carry away the ſubſtance of our whole diſcourſe, which for this effect, wee draw to only four pomits. <hi>First</hi> I ſhall ſhew that wee muſt have ſome infallible Iudge, or Rule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding all our neceſſary Controverſies, to which Rule wee will ſhew all men bound vnder paine of damnation to ſubmit even with interior ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Iudgment. <hi>Secondly</hi> I will ſhew att large that the Scripture is not this Iudge or Rule, which point will require a very full examination, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe our adverſaries ground them ſelves mainly in the contrary opinion, and all our new Sects have no other ground at all. I will ſhew <hi>Thirdly</hi> that this
<pb facs="tcp:62436:9"/>
infallible Iudge can be no other (as things ſtand) then the true Catholike Church; And this muſt be alſo fully handled becauſe it is the ground of our Religion; And the true Reſolution of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s depends wholy on itt. <hi>Lastly</hi> I will ſhew that all the arguments, which convince the true Catholike Church to be this Iudge, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Roman, and no Church but the Roman. To be this infallible Iudge to whom all conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt be bound vnder paine of damnation to ſubmitt theyr Iudgments, and accordingly live vnited to her Communion; this bleſſed vnion will end our Controverſies.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Indeed this Queſtion of Queſtions truely reſolved quite vndermineth the foundation of all Sects oppoſit to the Roman Church, ſhewing vs a moſt eaſy, and yet a moſt ſafe way, how in theſe times the moſt learned and vnlearned may find the true Religion, to witt, by following the Iudgment of that Iudge, whom God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them in all doubts of Religion to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llow. And therefore, in this infinite confuſion of new fangled Sects, this Queſtion (though never ſo often handled heretofore,) ſeemeth now more neceſſary then ever, even although I ſhould do nothing, elſe but publiſh new Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of ould arguments; ſuch Coppies beeing now ſo very neceſſary to be thruſt into every mans hands. My beſt indeavours ſhall aime at making
<pb facs="tcp:62436:9"/>
theſe arguments truly publick: that is to ſet them downe ſo plainly, and in ſo vulgar and cleer lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, devoide of Schoole Tearmes, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary people may fully conceave and perfectly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the force of them. If my endeavours in this can be ſucceſſefull, I hope this work, after ſo many other mens writings will, not be vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable at leaſt for the vulgar. But they muſt have patience with a long anſwer to a moſt important and ample Queſtion.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>VVhether there muſt be ſome Infallible Iudge, or Rule to deduce all neceſſary Controverſies to whom all are bound vnder paine of damnation to ſubmit their vnderſtandings. <hi>AND</hi> How orderly wee proceed to the finding out of this Iudge.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Queſtion is put in the firſt place, rather for order ſake, then for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batable difficulty which it contaynes. For all Chriſtians, of what Religion ſo euer they be, do agree in this, that there muſt be ſome certain and aſſured mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to end all Controverſies or doubts, which either be, or can be in Religion. The reaſon is apparent, becauſe otherwiſe euery man might be left free to belieue what he iudged beſt, and ſo wee should ſoon haue as many Religions as there be priuate and different iudgments. Truth is but one: wherefore though all theſe different opinions may be falſe, yet it is manifeſt that, (though they be thouſands,) but only one of them can be true. For whoſoeuer differeth from this one opinion which is true, differeth from the truth. S. Paul tels vs (11. Hebr: 6.) <hi>Without Faith it is imposſible to pleaſe God.</hi> That is, it is impoſſible to pleaſe him <hi>without true Faith:</hi> for he is not pleaſed <hi>with falſe Faith.</hi> Without wee pleaſe God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62436:11"/>
it is impoſſible to be ſaved, and you ſee it is impoſſible to pleaſe him with out true Faith. And againe you ſee that true Faith cannot be found in quite contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, of which one only can be true, there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore be ſome meanes to know this one true Faith from ſo infinite a multitude of falſe opinions. What meanes is this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be a meanes infallible, as all Chriſtians agree, but Socinians. For if it be fallible, all Religion may be a phanſy. Chriſtian Faith is an infallible aſſent, to which no fallible meanes can bring vs. This meanes therefore muſt be infallible. Hitherto wee all agree. See whitaker <hi>Cont.</hi> 1. <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All alſo can not but agree in this, that our inward vnderſtanding muſt be bound, vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſubmit it ſelfe vnto that infallible Iudge, or Rule appointed by God to decide all neceſſary Controverſies. For if you in your private judgment, without any fault at all, may follow what you really thinke fitteſt to be followed, why may not I, as well as you; And an other as well as you or I, follow what really ſeemeth fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be followed? Wherefore, it were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all (in order to the preſervation of vnity in faith) to have an infallible Iudge, vnleſſe every man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular were bound, by a moſt ſtrict precept, to ſubmit to that Iudge. Again he who ſhould not ſubmit to an authority acknowledged to be appointed by God to ſuch an end, ſhould manifeſtly reſiſt to be governed by that meanes by which the Divine Providence had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to govern him, which is a damnable rebellion againſt God; and an act of high treaſon it is againſt the Divine Majeſty, to refuſe to ſtand to the judgement of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62436:11"/>
that Iudge, or determination of that Rule which God hath placed, for no other end but for all to ſtand and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt vnto it, that by this ſubmiſſion, they may be guided infallibly to that one true Faith, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God, or be ſaved. Now becauſe all Faith eſſentially conſiſteth in the inward vnderſtanding (which is the very ſeat of true or falſe Faith) God, who looketh vpon our interior Soule, exacteth to ſee in that a ready imbracing of that Faith, without which no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be had, and therefore he ſhould not ſeriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly deſire our Salvation, vnleſſe he deſired that wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly yealded full aſſent to this one, and only Saving Faith, which Faith conſiſting eſſentially (as I ſayd) in the interior judgment, God would haue this judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t readely to ſubmitt to that infallible Iudges determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, as the only meanes to bring vs aſſuredly to this one true Faith. Things which are neceſſary to pleaſe God. muſt of neceſſity be things of precept and ſtrict co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, even vnder paine of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, becauſe our very greateſt obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of all obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, is to obey his will, and pleaſure. And his Sacred pleaſure is to exact that moſt at our hands, which is moſt for our good, and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth moſt for our Salvation. True Faith therefore bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſary meanes to bring vs to our eternall good, he, with all reaſon, exacteth of vs all, to ſubmit our interior vnderſtanding (the very ſeat of true or falſe Faith) to the full aſſent of that, which shall be preſcribed vs to believe, by that meanes, which his holy providence shall aſſigne vs, for our guidance in Faith: that ſo all may be vnited in Faith interiorly: for in deede otherwiſe they be not of one Faith at all. And hence again appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that this meanes muſt be infallible, for it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62436:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that God ſhould put a Command vpon all to follow that which might lead to any errour great, or litle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Out of this generall doctrine, received vniverſally without any conſiderable contradiction, there followeth manifeſtly this conſequence, that two men, of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions, cannot be ſaved, if both of them know what doctrine is taught them, by that infallible Iudge or Rule, appointed them by God to be followed, as theyr guide, in matters of Faith. For both theſe men, knowing on the one ſide that God hath put an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon them, to ſubmitt to the believing of that, which is propoſed by his infallible Iudge or Rule; and yet, on the other ſide, one of them flatly refuſing to believe what is thus propoſed vnto him; this one who proceedeth thus muſt needs be guilty of the damnable ſinne of refractary disobedience againſt the express command of God, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſtrictly all to ſubmitt to the Iudge appointed by him, to guide all to the neceſſary true Faith, and knowne to be ſo appointed: Hence it is Scripture: <hi>He who doth not believe shall be damned. Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 16. And of thoſe who follow ſects, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.21. <hi>They who do theſe things shall not obteyn the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe principles I lay down ſo diſtinctly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, and will again inculcate at the ending, that all may ſee of how high concernment it is to make vſe of this meanes, wholy neceſſary to that only true Faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God and to be ſaved. They therefore are in a damnable caſe, who beeing ſtrictly obliged to vſe that meanes, which is wholy neceſſary to come to the knowledge of this only true Faith, do not informe them ſelves carefully to find out this meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to guide and direct all to this only true
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62436:12"/>
Faith, either fondly believing that men of contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions may be ſaved (which wee have juſt now proved to be falſe, except in caſe of invincible ignorance) or elſe by damnable negligence, omiting to vſe that ſerious care in ſeeking out, and ſolicitouſly ſearching, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of this meanes, which they are obliged to do in a matter concerning a no leſſe buſines, then an eternity of everlaſting bliſſe; or never ending miſery. Now leaſt any one ſhould ſecretly diſpaier of finding out this meanes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo grow ſlack in the ſearch of it (which is the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe of many thouſands) I (in my preface at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) tooke care to ſhew, that, even ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t people, might, by a very tolerable care, come to the knowledge of this meanes, or elſe God had not ſufficiently, according to his moſt ſweet Providence, provided for the farre greater part of thoſe Soules, for whoſe Salvation he died, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſave them all, by firſt bringing them to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this only true Faith; and conſequently, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to leave them ſome certain meanes, to come to the knowledge of it, by ſuch diligence as is very tolerable to human frailety, and very poſſible to vs, as ignorant as wee are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What then is this meanes? It is (as I ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Queſtion) to follow ſome infallible Iudge or Rule, directing vs plainly and clearly to the knowledge of what God would have vs believe, to whom wee are all bound vnder paine of damnation to ſubmit our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. But who is this Iudge or Rule? This is the Queſtion of Queſtions. Here wee and all Proteſtants, and all other Sectaries notably diſagree. They all ſay that wee are obliged to follow, and admitt no other infallible Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le then the Scripture, which Scripture they all affirme to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62436:13"/>
be a Rule ſufficient, by it ſelfe a lone, to tell vs ſo plainly, and ſo cleerly, all that is neceſſary to Salvation in matters of Faith, that wee need no other meanes to direct vs in this point. Wee, who are Roman Catholikes hold the Scripture to be indeed a Rule infallible, and to which all are bound, vnder pain of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſubmit theyr vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; but wee have very many, and very convincing reaſons, which move vs to believe that God did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Holy Scripture to be, by it ſelfe alone, our only guide in matters of faith neceſſary to Salvation, as I ſhew by fiue proofes in the firſt Section. Moreover wee ſay that wee ſtand in need of ſome other infallible guide to know many things neceſſary to Salvation, which be not clearly ſet down in Scripture, and I ſhall ſhew no fewer then 24. all not to be knowne by Scripture, wich doth not tell vs wich Books be the true word of God, which be not, wich be true vncorrupted coppies of theſe Bookes, which Coppies be falſe and corrupted, and in what places they be corrupted. Here comes in an vnanſwerable difficulty about <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Goſpel. Again wee ſtand in need of an other infallible guide to tell vs which is the true, certain and vndoubted ſenſe of theſe true Coppies, and which is not. For, from hence arriſe almoſt all our grateſt Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. Again, becauſe our adverſaries without ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guide, different from Scriptures, can neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly know which books be the true word of God, which be not; nor which be the true Originall Coppies of theſe true books, which not; nor which the true Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the true originals; nor which is the vndoubted ſenſe of theſe true Originals or Coppies, and which is not. Hence wee conceive it impoſſible for them truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Scripture with that divine Faith, which is grounded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62436:13"/>
allwayes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divine revelation, and is wholy neceſſary to ſalvatio. Whence wee hould our ſelves only to be the true believers of Scripture; for we beleeue it with that Faith which reſteth vpon divine revelation. Moreover by our adverſaries arguments alleadged out of Scripture, to proue it to be the only Rule of Faith, ſufficient by it ſelfe to decide all neceſſary Controverſies, wee proue that it is not ſuch a Rule. Yea though Scripture were granted to be this Rule, wee from hence can prove, that it cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth many neceſſary Controverſies for vs againſt our adverſaries. But wee hould that, for our Rule cleerly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all neceſſary Controverſies, wee muſt have a Living Iudge which the Scripture is not, and therefore the Holy Fathers, in theyr diſputations againſt Heretikes, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſtand to Scripture only. This infallible Living Iudge wee ſay is the Church, regulating her ſelfe in her determinations according to the infallible Rule of Gods word, out of which word ſhee judgeth her ſelfe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged alſo to Rule her ſelfe according to thoſe Traditions which the Apoſtles did deliver by word of mouth only, and not by writing. For the Scripture not conteyning all matters neceſſary to Salvation; but the Apoſtoles of Chriſt delivering ſome of theſe matters only by word of mouth, ſhee ruleth alſo her ſelfe in her definitions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe traditions knowing that thoſe things which the Apoſtoles taught by word of mouth, are no leſſe worthy all credit, then what they taught by pen and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And by the ſame Traditions ſhe is as ſufficiently aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of what was delivered only by word of mouth, as of what was delivered by pen and paper. Now leaſt that in taking true Sripture for falſe, true Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for falſe, or in delivering the true Senſe of the one, or the other, this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62436:14"/>
Church ſhould be ſubject to error, wee ſay, ſhee is in theſe matters, alwayes aſſiſted in her publike determinations, by the infallible aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, promiſed to her for this e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to lead her in to all truth. That cheife Court, in which ſhee delivereth to the people her infallible Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, wee all hold to be lawfull generall Councels, which the ſupreme Paſtor of the Church preſideth. Neither doth this Church want meanes to make all her decrees evidently knowne to the people, to be her true Decrees. And all this, which hath hitherto been ſayd of the Church in generall, wee ſhew to be verified only of the Roman Church; of whom alſo all theſe prime things which the Scriptures ſay of the true Church, are verified, and vnited in her alone: The Roman Church therefore beenig this our infallible Iudge appointed by God to end, and determin all our Controverſies, all vnder pain of damnation are to ſubmit theyr inward Iudgements and vnderſtandings to her decrees, Neither are they in ſtate of Salvation who refuſe to do it.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

If they by theyr private jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of diſcretion be convinced that, what they ſay, is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62436:15"/>
not agreable to Scripture, they freely reject it, and disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it. And this hath ever been the proceeding of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heretikes and is ever like to be the proceeding of all Heretikes to come For by this meanes thy all come to that, which they all deſire, that is, to have that paſſe for truth which each of them, in theyr private judgements of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do think to be true according to theyr manner of vnderſtanding the Scripture. And they all truſt more to theyr private vnderſtanding of the Scripture, then they do truſt to the interpretation of it made by the greateſt Doctors that ever the Church of God had for theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundered yeares, how holy or how learned ſo ever they were: Yea more then they will truſt all the cheife Paſtours and Prelats of the Church-aſſembled in a General Councell, after they have with all mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration conſidered all the texts of Scriptures coneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch a point and conferred them with the originals, and with other places, and after they have examined each Biſhop of each nation what they find to have been delivered to them by theyr a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceſtors touching this point, by much prayer, and publick faſts of all the Church diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, implored the aſſiſtance of Allmigty God to direct them to the knowledge of the truth in ſuch a poinct. For after all this done, and after all theſe prime learned, and Holy Prelats of the Church, have, by full conſent, defined ſuch a point to be held as true, and that vnder paine of excommunication. Behould! When this decree Cometh forth, there will ſtart vp ſome devout Cobler, or Weaver: he will take this decree into the one hand, and in the other he will take his Engliſh Bible, tranſlated by ſome body (though neither I, nor he have any aſſurance of his honeſty or skill, or of the vncorruptednes of the Coppy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62436:15"/>
by which this Engliſh Bible was tranſlated) yet into his hands he will take it. And then ſincerely he will make a reuew of this decree, or of the whole book of decrees, made by this, or by any generall Councell. And then if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ſerious peruſal of the matter his rude vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, according to his privat judgement of diſcretion, doth in good earneſt think this Decree (or all theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees) to be contrary to the word of God (rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by him) this man, according to the principles of our adverſaries, may ſecurely disbelieve this doctrine, though propoſed by ſo great an authority as I have ſayd, yea though this authority, as they them ſelves ſay, be the very greateſt authority vpon earth. To relate this prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinion is enough to refute it; and to ſhew how far more rationally wee Roman Catholiks rather truſt to the interpretations of generall Councels, which wee on the one ſide find ſeconded every where by the authority of the graveſt Doctors of the Church of God, according to theyr judgement of diſcretion, and the Tradition and judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perpetuall practiſe of their Anceſtours. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on, the other ſide wee ſee our own ſelves, that all this is to the very full as much yea and farre more agreable to the word of God according to our owne private judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherefore in this reſpect wee are to the very full as well grounded as they, and wee ſee as well what wee do: But wee infinitly exceed them in the advantage that wee have, by following not only our owne, but alſo a farre better ſighted judgement the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our owne, even in the uſe of naturall reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beſides which reaſon thoſe Generall Councels have a more ſpeciall aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. And thus wee perſever in all ages in all vnity, whileſt they in this one age have ſo runne diviſion vpon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62436:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ground of Scripture, that the meer relation of theyr ſeverall Sects in this one age, with the ſeverall opinions of every Sect of this age, filleth whole books, which be to to be ſeen in every Stationers Shoppe. And it is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der if any new year paſſe without one or more Religions ſpringing vp, as long as this one Principle paſſeth for current, and men may have free liberty to follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which manifeſtly follow from it, as of late they have it. If this dayly hatching of Religions happened not ſooner, it was becauſe this liberty was not graunted ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For althouh theyr Biſhops held the doctrine of giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all liberty to follow in Conſcience what they in theyr private judgements of diſcretion held to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods word; yet they very inconſequently, forced theyr Conſciences to an exterior conformity, as long as theyr power laſted, for fear that ſhould not laſt long, if men were permitted to practiſe what they were permitted and taught to believe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But to go on more orderly, wee ſay the Bible by it ſelfe alone is not this Iudge, or rule appointed by God to decide all neceſſary Controverſies, without you take the Bible as it, by many and very cleer texts, ſends vs for more full inſtruction to the Church. In this ſenſe, it is moſt true that the Bible is a very ſufficient Rule, as ſhall hereafter be more fully declared. But wee deny that, which our adverſaries affirme, that the Bible, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by it ſelfe, doth ſuffice to decide, and end all our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. This I prove firſt; by an argument ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that, in theſe dayes, he muſt put out his eyes who will not ſee the truth of it. For who ſeeth not now the Bible dayly conſulted, place conferred with place, the beſt originals ſearched for, and looked for, and publiſhed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62436:16"/>
then ever (wee having the advantage of printing:) and yet after this; who ſeeth not that Controverſies about the very cheefe points of Religion, are ſo far from beeing leſſened, that never was age ſeen, or heard of, in which they multiplied more No ſooner had <hi>Martin Luther</hi> broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this Principle, that every man might take the Bible into his hand, and follow that interpretation, which after due diligence vſed, he thought to be beſt; but preſently, there ſprung vp an incredible number of different Sects. For An. 1526. <hi>Caroloſtadius, Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>OEcolampadius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach that opinion of the Sacramentaries, which denieth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be really preſent in the Sacrament (an opinion which <hi>Luther</hi> did curſe vntill his very death.) The next year after <hi>Paciomontanus</hi> and <hi>Rothomannus,</hi> reteyning other opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> brought in <hi>Anabaptiſme.</hi> And theſe <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are now growne to be devided into twenty different Sects, all deſcribed particularly by <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius.</hi> In fine <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his diſciples did ſo tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about theyr new Religion, turning it with ſo many chopps, and changes, that <hi>OEcolampadius</hi> objected vnto them, <hi>If wee reflect vpon your diſſentions, ſurely there are almoſt found among you ſeventy ſeven changes. Aequa reſponſio ad Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therum.

                  <p n="3">3. Now in the year 1538. <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> a diſciple of <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> deſpiſing his maſter did ſet vp of him ſelfe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to that of the Sacramentarians. This mans Religion, and his diſciples began ſo quikly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and ſubdivided in to ſo many ſects, that <hi>Luther</hi> did
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62436:17"/>
live to write thus of them: <hi>I ſcarce ever read of a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed bereſy, which preſently in the beginning was divided into ſo many heads, ſuch a number of Sects</hi> (mark what followeth) <hi>not one like an other, and ſuch variety and diſagreeing of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> Tom. 7. f. 380. And in another place he addeth, <hi>Six or ſeven Sects of them to have riſen in only two yeares ſpace.</hi> T. 6. f. 335. Thus much could <hi>Luther</hi> ſay of theyr very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. Wee, at this day, ſee that his Engliſh diſciples can ring the Changes as well as any of theyr forefathers, ſo that now every family is like a houſe in which the Maſter ſpeaketh high Dutch, the Miſtres French, the children one Spaniſh, one Iriſh, one Scotiſh, and ſome ſervants welch, ſome Iaponian, ſome Polonian &amp;c. And all this Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian confuſion proceeds from this one principle, of thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Bible (in the vulgar language) into every hand with teaching them this Principle, Behould here is the only Rule God hath given you to Rule your owne ſelves by; and by which Every one is to Iudge for him ſelfe, which is true doctrine, which is falſe, after he hath vſed ſuch induſtries, as ſhall be declared, Sect. 2. n. 13. Though eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the vſe of all thoſe induſtries wee do ſee with our eyes no end preſent, or ever like to be made of our Controverſies ſtill encreaſing, and encreaſing like Snow falling from a mountain.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A Second Reaſon much illuſtrating and declaring the former (becauſe it diſcouereth the true original cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe why wee ſhall ſee no controverſies ever ended by ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only to the Sentence given by God in the Bible) is this, that whilſt wee take thus the Scripture for our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule, and God, as he ſpeaketh by the Scriptures alone, for our only Iudge, wee needs muſt fall into a vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For every one of vs having our private Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62436:17"/>
as different almoſt from one an other, as our faces are, and theſe Iudgements beeing ſo very weake in hard, and high matters, how can it be but that preſently wee ſhould come to frame different Iudgements of the true Sence and interpretation of that ſentence which wee find giuen by God in Scripture as ſhall be very fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Sect. 7. well then in this variety of judgements you ſay wee may refuſe to ſtand to the interior imbracing of that interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is made by the graveſt generall Councell that can be gathered vpon earth, vnles, peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the definition of this Councel, wee, in our private Iudgement of diſcretion, Iudge it conformable to the word. But if (after vſe of ſuch induſtries as you requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) wee, according to our private Iudgement (ſo very various and ſo very weake in points ſo hard) do really think the definition not to be conformable to Scripture, then (you ſay) wee may interiorly diſſent from it, And yet it is true that all faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſts in the interior aſſent. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it followeth that the laſt Rule which is followed, when all comes to all, is the Scripture, not taken as it ſounds (for that wee all reject) but taken in that ſence which our private Iudgement (for this is your doctrine) draweth from it. This is that, ſay wee, which openeth a wide gap to all Sectaries and D. Fern in his 13. Sect. in vain labours to ſhew the contrary by telling them they muſt bring <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scripture and demonſtration againſt publick authority of the Church And that vpon diſſent and gainſaying they muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Churches cenſures,</hi> which ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſures, according to our adverſaries doctrine, ſhall nothing hurt your Soul. And he concludeth, <hi>that there is no other meanes to preſerve vnity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Church.</hi> But queſtionles this meanes is moſt vnef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, which both experience teacheth vs (as I have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62436:18"/>
juſt now ſhewed) and the very confideration alſo of the Nature of the meanes. For this meanes muſt at laſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by men, that is, by thoſe to whome Nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as different judgements in theyr vnderſtandings, as affections in their love and wills. Well now, when this weake, this moſt fallible and moſt various vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hath got in to his hands the Rule, by which only every one is to be directed in Faith, what can wee expect but that, as every ones judgement is different, ſo alſo will the Faith of every one be. And every one believing that to be evident which he judgeth to be ſo, Every one will ſincerly ſay that he bringeth evident demonſtrations of Scripture, and therefore he contradicteth publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority vpon as good ground as you did, when you (at your diviſion from the Roman Church) did contradict, not only her authority, but alſo the publick known doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of all other Churches which God had viſible, at that time, vpon the face of the earth. <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> wittily ſayth: <hi>what was lawfull to Valentinus was lawfull to the Valentinians.</hi> As lawfully as <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> and others did ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te from all the Prelats and Paſtors of the Church of theyr age. So lawfully at the leaſt the Lutherians, Zuinglians, Calviniſts may ſeperate from them and theyr few new Prelats and Paſtors, and may according to the example which theſe men gave them, make them ſelves indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d caſt of this remna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dency not only of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher Prelates, but alſo of all inferior Curates: for this is but to go on conſequently to the example given vnto them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But for the importance of the matter, I will further declare this by a cleer example, which may here after be vſefull to vs. Let vs take an <hi>Arrian Cobler,</hi> and give him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62436:18"/>
one great principle more of D: Ferns, <hi>that his part is the negative:</hi> for he denieth the affirmative doctrine of thoſe who teach, that God the Sonne is of the very ſelfe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſubſtance with his Father; and that conſequently our Church muſt ſhew him evident Scripture for what wee affirme. If you tell him, the great Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> hath vnanimouſly declared the ſenſe of theſe words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>I and my Father am one thing,</hi> to be this, that God the Sonne is one and the ſelfe ſame ſubſtance with is Father, though yet he be a different perſon: well, will he ſay, I reverence Councels very higly, yet I muſt peruſe theyr decrees, and conſider how conformable they be to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I beginning to do this, began to ponder how God the Father and his Sonne are one thing; being they be quite different perſons? And ſurely this different perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, in all reaſon, ſhould be a different thing. How then (ſayd I) are they one thing? Is it not perhaps the true meaning of theſe words, that they are one thing only by affection? As I have often been tould by our great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. This I can eaſely vnderſtand: I will ſee a litle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether this interpretation, conferred with other texts of Scripture, may not be found to be very good. I conferred it with the text, which one of our Doctors ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.21. where Chriſt prayeth to his Father <hi>That all his diſciples may be One thing, as thou Father in mee, and I in thee.</hi> Here I marked that Chriſt demanded, that his diſciples <hi>might be one thing, as he and his Father are one thing.</hi> Now every body ſeeth, that Chriſt never begged, that his diſciples might <hi>be one thing in ſubſtance with</hi> him. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I manifeſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that I now am not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced of my negative opinion, for which I have all human reaſons; but contrary wiſe I bring for my opinion the evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62436:19"/>
of Scripture, againſt the publick authority of the Councel of Nice. Wherefore if the followers of that Councel preſſe mee to make publik profeſſion, that God the Sonne is of the ſame ſubſtance with his Father, I may and muſt gainſay them all. Good M. Doctor either convince this <hi>Arrian Cobler,</hi> or give vs better ſatisfaction why you deny, that theſe your principles open a gap for Sectaries, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d even ſuch Sectaries as overthrow the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of true Religion, as you confeſſe this <hi>Arrian</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe doth. And juſt as this <hi>Cobler</hi> proceeds in denying this Conſubſtantiation, ſo you proceed in denying Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. Only he who denyes Confuſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably ſtronger reaſons and better authority of Scripture for himſelfe. Of this review of Councels ſee <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. <hi>n.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A third reaſon, why wee ſay Scripture not to be our only Iudge, is; that our very adverſaries confeſſe, no one Book of Scripture, nor no certain number of Canonicall Books, to be our Iudge: but they ſay the whole Canon, or all the Canonicall Bookes together, make vp the only Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, by which wee are to be wholy directed. Now if this be ſo, that you will have vs judged by all Canonicall Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, then you muſt agree to tell vs, which Bookes for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be thoſe which belong to the making vp the whole number of Canonicall Bookes. For it is a moſt juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to ask of you, by what Iudge you would have vs to be judged? You ſay by all Canonicall Bookes. Give vs leave to aske how many, and which bookes they be? Your Engliſh Bible thruſteth out of the Canon, and placeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the apocrypha, ſome halfe a ſcore Bookes which wee hould for Canonicall. Again, your Engliſh Bible ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into the Canon of Scriptures, divers Bookes which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62436:19"/>
your <hi>Lutheran Bretheren</hi> caſt out: as the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the Hebrews, the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames;</hi> the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> the ſecond, and third of <hi>S. Iohn;</hi> the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iude;</hi> the Apocalyps or Revelation. Wee then ſay vnto you, agree at leaſt firſt, by which Bookes you would have the Canon to be compleatly made up, and then preſſe vs by your arguments to be judged by them alone. This at leaſt wee have reaſon to ſay; but wee conceiue our ſelves alſo to have reaſon to exact of you, to demonſtrate vnto vs, that the Bookes of Machabees (by which wee prove Purgatory) and the other Bookes which you are pleaſed to diſcannon, do not Belong to the making vp of the true Canon. Yet when you have done this, or allowed vs all theſe Bookes for Canonicall, wee ſhall not have the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bookes requiſite to make the full Canon. Hence followeth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A fourth reaſon, that many, and very many of the Canonical Bookes of Scripture have quite periſhed, and not ſo much as appeared in the dayes of the very ancient Fathers: ſo that nothing but the names of theſe Bookes are come vnto vs. <hi>Adamus Contzen</hi> in his Proëmiall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to his Commentaries vpon the 4. Ghoſples <hi>Q.</hi> 4. §. 8. doth not only affirme, but moſt ſolidly prove, that no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then twenty ſeverall Bookes of Scripture have thus wholy periſhed. <hi>Serrarius</hi> doth the ſame. I will give you the names of ſome of theſe Bookes. In the Book of numbers c. 21. v. 14. wee read thus: <hi>It is ſayd in the Book of the wars of the Lord.</hi> Where is this Booke? It is quite periſhed. In the third Book of Kings (which you call the firſt) <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>Salomon Spoke three thouſand Proverbs: and his Canticles were a thouſand and five.</hi> Where be theſe Bookes? What a ſmall part have wee of them? In the ſecond Book of <hi>Chronicles
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62436:20"/>
c</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 29. it is ſayd. <hi>Now the reſt of the acts of Salomon firſt and laſt, are they not written in the Book of Nathan the Prophet, and in the Propheſie of Ahijah and in the viſion of Iddo.?</hi> Where be theſe three ſeverall Prophets Bookes. They are all quite periſhed. And the firſt Booke of Chro: endeth with theſe words, <hi>Now the Acts of David the King firſt and laſt behould be they not written in the Book of Samuel the Seer, and in the Book of Nathan the Prophet, and in the Book of Gad the Seer?</hi> Where alſo be theſe ſeverall Prophets Bookes? They be quite loſt. In the laſt to the Coloſſians <hi>S. Paul</hi> Commands to read in the Church the Epiſtle from <hi>Laodicia.</hi> Whereis it? It appeares not. He alſo in his firſt to the Corinthians <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 9. ſayth. <hi>I wrot to you in an Epiſtle.</hi> Where is this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to them which he wrote before <hi>the firſt</hi> that wee haue vnto them? It appeaers not. <hi>S. Matthew</hi> (whoſe Hebrew Ghoſpel is now quite loſt) in his 27. <hi>Chap. v.</hi> 9. citeth words ſpoken by the <hi>Prophet Ieremy,</hi> which be not to be found in all <hi>Ieremy</hi> as wee now have him. Wherefore part of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> is alſo periſhed, as Contze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce excellently proveth out of Chron: 2. <hi>c.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>S. Matthew</hi> alſo <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 23. ſayth. <hi>It was ſpoken by the Prophets, He shall be called a Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aren.</hi> The Bookes of thoſe Prophets who ſpoke this are alſo periſhed, for wee find Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called a Nazaren in all the Prophets Bookes which wee have. Whence <hi>S. Chryſoſtom</hi> writing on this place <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</hi> 9. <hi>in Mat.</hi> ſayth, <hi>Many of the Propheticall monuments have periſhed; for the Iewes beeing careles, and not only careles, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo impious, they have Careleſly loſt ſome of theſe Monuments: others they have partly burned, partly torn in peeces.</hi> So he, Now thoſe Bookes which the Iewes out of impious mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce burned, or tore a peeces, are moſt likely to have been ſuch as they did ſee the Apoſtles to cite moſt for the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62436:20"/>
proof of Chriſtian doctrine as alſo it appeareth by theyr making away the Prophets Bookes cited by <hi>S. Matthew.</hi> See <hi>S. Iuſtin</hi> againſt Tryphon ſhewing that the Iewes did make away many Bookes of the ould Teſtament, that the new might not ſeeme to agree with it, as it ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Well then by all this it is manifeſt that many, and very many Bookes of Scripture have quite periſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe many which you your ſelves thurſt vniuſtly out of your Bible. Will you have us now, in all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies about neceſſary points, be wholy judged <hi>by all</hi> the Bookes of the Scripture? Then bring them forth <hi>all,</hi> that wee may know what is write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>in all</hi> of them. For who can doubt but many things, as neceſſary as others that are in the Bookes wee have, were writen in theſe Bookes which wee have not? Eſpecially the Iewes malitiouſly beeing moſt likely to have deſtroyed thoſe Bookes firſt, which conteyned the moſt cleer places for our Religion. Where is it written that all things neceſſary to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be written in the Bookes which wee now have? Cite mee a Text proving this, and I have done. Nay you your ſelves teach, that all the whole body of the Bookes of Scripture is required, to give us thoſe points which are neceſſary to Salvation: and the reaſon is, becauſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſigne any particular Bookes, or particular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particular bookes, conteyning cleerly all theſe neceſſary points. Yea, wee ſhall prove, that there bee no fewer then twenty foure neceſſary points, which are, not conteyned in any of thoſe Bookes of Scripture which wee have, whether they were conteyned in the Bokes which have periſhed, no man but a Prophet can tell; or if they were, then (now at leaſt) ſince they are periſhed, wee cannot know theſe neceſſary points by them. Yet, theſe points beeing neceſſary to be known, God muſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62436:21"/>
provide vs of ſome other meanes to know them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. A fifth reaſon. If either all the bookes of Scripture, or ſome particular number of them, had conteyned the only neceſſary direction, for every man to guide him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe by, in all points neceſſary to Salvation, it cannot be doubted but the Apoſtles, who ſpent all theyr labours and liues, in ſeeking the Salvation of Soules, and who knew very well that, on the one ſide true Faith in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neceſſary for beliefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d practice, was wholy neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Salvation of every one; and knew alſo on the otherſide (as you muſt ſay) that the only meanes, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for theyr neceſſary direction in this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faith, was the Scripture, and nothing but the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, by which every man was to Iudge for him ſelfe; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I ſay, be doubted but they (had this been true) would either them ſelves have procured, the Scriptures to be put into ſuch toungs, and languages, as the vulgar people of ſo many different nations vſe, and only underſtand; for without theyr underſtanding the Scriptures, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to direct them ſelves by them: and with out they direct them ſelves by them, it is impoſſible to be rightly directed to the knowledge of that Faith, with out which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. The Apoſtles knew this to the full as well as you, if it be true; And yet wee could never heare, that they tooke ſo much as the leaſt care by them ſelves, or charged theyr ſucceſſors to take the leaſt care, to turne the Scripture, either all, or that part which is ſo wholy neceſſary, in to ſuch languages as the ſeverall people of theſe ſeverall nations (which they converted) did vſe: neither could wee ever hear, that theyr ſucceſſors (ſo very well inſtructed by them) did ever take the leaſt care to do this, ſo wholy neceſſary to be done, if your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62436:21"/>
be true. Yet you all deny, that theyr immediate Succeſſors did ſet forth our Latin vulgar edition, which is the moſt ancient of all Latin editions, <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> living ſo long in Rome cauſed no part of the bible to be tranſlated into the Romiſh language: yea <hi>S. Paul</hi> writes to them in Greek.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Some anſwer, that the Apoſtles tooke this care becauſe they writt the greateſt part of the new Teſtament in Greek. And then, they beeing put to prove that gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke was vnderſtood either by all, or by the greater part of the world, they prove this moſt pittifully, by only ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Tully pro Archia Poëta</hi> ſaying. <hi>Graeca omnibus fere genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus leguntur. Greek is read almoſt in all nations.</hi> I anſwer, that as wee commonly ſay, that <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> in latin, are read in al nations; and yet our meaning only is, that the more learned ſort in all nations read theſe latin bookes: ſo, in this ſence, <hi>Tully</hi> may ſo much the eaſier be ſuppoſed to haue ſaid, Greek was read <hi>almoſt</hi> in all nations, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he added the word <hi>Almoſt</hi> even then, when he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this his ſaying in an encomiaſticall Oration, in which Orators make freeſt vſe of amplifications, and hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall exaggerations ever without any reſtrictions at all; eſpecially when ſuch Amplifications be for theyr turn, as here it was for <hi>Tully</hi> his turne, becauſe he was to ſhew that this man (though a Greek Poët) could by his Greek Poëtry make the Romans famous, Greek Poëts beeing read, by the learned ſort of the neigbouring nations, and the fame among the learned of thoſe natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beeing chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to be regarded. And either, in this vſuall ſenſe, <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> muſt be vnderſtood; or elſe flat Scripture muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. For the Scriptuer <hi>Act.</hi> 2. intending on ſet purpoſe to give vs the names of ſeverall people whoſe languages
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62436:22"/>
were all different one from another, at the beginning of the Church, nameth <hi>Pontus, Cappadocia, Aſia</hi> (minor) <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, Pamphilia,</hi> all which places are ſituated between that Citty, which now wee call Conſtantinople, and the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Antioch, in which town <hi>Tully</hi> ſayth that Poët, which he vndertook to prayſe, was born. Within that compaſſe alſo is <hi>Galatia,</hi> which <hi>S. Ierom</hi> teſtifieth to haue had a language ſome what like that of Trevers. Now, if even in theſe places, where a man, by Tully his words, would moſt imagin the Greek toung to be the Vulgar la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it is manifeſt (by Scripture it ſelfe) that it was not ſo; ſurely wee haue all reaſon to imagin, that in remoter parts, both in Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, it was in few places the vulgar language in reſpect of the farre greater part of the world. Call here to mind how much you vſe to cry out againſt vs, for uſing our common pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik prayer in latin, though this language, be ſo common among all wel bred people; and yet, this our Common pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik prayer is a thing only offered to God, for the people of all Nations; and not a thing ſpoken to the people of all Nations, for theyr neceſſary inſtruction, as you ſay all the Scripture was. And moreover Maſſe is offered vp by a Prieſt, who vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the language in which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp theſe publike Prayers: But the Scripture, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the new Teſtament, is delivered to every one of the people (as you teach) for every one to judge by it for himſelfe, what is neceſſary for him to believe, and to doe, to work his ſalvation; and this is his neceſſary direction appointed by God to be ſo. Why then do you not cry out much more againſt the Apoſtles, and theyr ill inſtructing theyr Succeſſors in ſo important a poinct, as was the communicating or delivering to the people of all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62436:22"/>
nations, in ſuch languages as were knowne to all nations vulgarly and commonly, that very Rule of Faith, ſo wholy neceſſary for theyr direction, that all other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are accounted by you fallible, and conſequently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to bring forth an infallible aſſent, ſuch an one as true ſaving faith muſt be. But the truth is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles knew well enough, that orall tradition, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the dayly profeſſion of the faith ſo delivered, and to the dayly practiſe, anſwerable to what they ſo profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would abundantly ſuffice for the ſufficient commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of Gods infallible word to all Nations.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. All this is confirmed by this demonſtration. The Iewes in theyr Captivity at Babilon did wholy looſe the vulgar vſe, and knowledge of the ould hebrew tounge in which the Law and Prophets were written, and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpok Syriack, a language Mixt with Hebrew and Chaldean, and wonderfull few by theyr private ſtudy did ſo much as vnderſtand Hebrew. This is teſtified by your own greateſt Doctors of antiquity, who now are ſetting forth that admirable bible at London (of which I ſhall ſpeak <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 8.) in theyr introduction they ſay: <hi>Certum eſt ante Chriſtum nullam fuiſſe verſionem Syram. It is certain that before Chriſts time</hi> (and ſome time after) <hi>there was no Scripture tranſlated into the Syriack language.</hi> So that for fourteene generations the Iewes had not the bible in theyr own vulgar language: but the law and Prophets were read in theyr Synagogue, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Pſalmes were ſung, in a language which the people no more vnderſtood the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they now vnderſtand latin. This was done before Chriſts own eyes, and he never found fault with it. An evident proofe of the lawfullnes of prayer in an vnknowne toung, and that God gave not the Iewes the Scripture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62436:23"/>
only for theyr Rule or Iudge: for then it would have been judged neceſſary to have been tranſlated into Syriak; the only toung they vnderſtood. Let us go on. Yet before wee proceed, let us note by the way; how ſoon you came to call your publick ſervice into queſtion, when once you had got it in your vulgar language: every vulgar fellow preſumes to cenſure it; yea it hath in your Courts been araigned and condemned: and is ſo vulgarly contemned that ſcarce any miniſter dares offer to read it. But wee muſt proceed to other Matters.</p>

theſe poor good people are moſt prepoſterouſly taught, to prefer the doctrine of theyr Miniſters, thus and only thus deduced, (even according to theyr own confeſſion) before the quite contrary conſequences deduced by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable better meanes: for what our Church teacheth in her generall Councels, is deduced from Gods Word by moſt skilfull, and moſt learned Prelates aſſembled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all parts of the world, bringing with them the beſt Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that can be got by them in the world: all chiefly hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regard to what was firſt delivered with theyr firſt faith.

Again the very conference of ſuch men with one an other, is a thing wonderfully helping to the finding out truth; to ſay nothing of the ſupernaturall aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, made farre ſurer; by promiſe of Chriſt, to them, then to any private Miniſters: what then more vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then to forſake them, to follow theſe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let vs go on. The world conſiſteth of people, commonly not very learned: For theſe men, God muſt have provided ſome way, to know clearly what they are obliged to believe, and to do for theyr ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For many things which are to be believed, are moſt hard to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: And many things muſt be practiced, which are very hard to be done. And the beliefe and practice of theſe things muſt oblige all the world, as long as the ſame ſhall continue. Now to oblige all for ever to this with out giving them meanes to know plainly and clearly, what they ſhould beleeve or doe, had been a thing vnreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in ſo ſweet a Providence, as that of our Heavenly Father is. This obligation then in every particular point which is neceſſarily to be beleeved, and done by vs, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62436:24"/>
the obteyning heaven and avoiding hell, muſt be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated to vs all, even in all and every one of theſe particulars. The meanes, by which this is only to be done, is the Scripture taken by it ſelf alone, as all you Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants teach: Wherefore an vnavoidable neceſſity doth fall vpon you, to affirme; <hi>that all things neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, or done, are plainly ſet down in Scripture:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what is not ſo delivered, is thereby ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified not to be neceſſary. As for your limitations, in declaring theſe words, <hi>plainly ſet down,</hi> whe ſhall (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what wee have already ſaid) ſay much more in the end of this Section and <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. Now wee muſt give a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct declaration of this <hi>your</hi> opinion, which perforce muſt be held by all kind of Proteſtants; for neceſſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them, who disagree ſo often, here wholy to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Firſt then, let vs declare thoſe firſt words of theyr aſſertion: <hi>All things neceſſary to be beleeved, or done.</hi> Theſe words muſt of neceſſity be vnderſtood ſo, that all things are plainly ſet down in Scripture, which are thus neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to the vniverſall Church, as it is a Community; <hi>Secondly,</hi> all things which are neceſſary to all ſuch ſtates, and degrees, as muſt needs be in ſo vaſtly diffuſed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> all things which are thus neceſſary, to every ſingle perſon, bound to be of this community.

Or they may be appointed her by meer laymen, having ſecular authority: and that, whether this ſecular authority be lawfully obteyned, or vnlawfully vſurped?

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62436:26"/>
of a whole Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Alſo a Doctor could not but know that neither the name of ſuch a Synod, nor the thing ſignified by this name, were ſo much as conteyned in the Bible. What then is this but to ſpeak juſt what is for the preſent turn? Mr. Doctor this authority of nationall Synods, beeing made by you the fondation of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly reforming, (though perhaps out of policy to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe dayly borne Sects) ſhould have been proved by you, by evident demonſtration of Scripture, to be ſo great, that it may lawfully ſtand in oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vpon the face of the whole Earth. Now as the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a whole nation is ſo neerly concerned in the true, or vſurped authority of a nationall Synod, or Councel; ſo the ſalvation of all nations is no less concerned in the true, or vſurped authority of a generall Councell: and yet <hi>firſt,</hi> the Scripture neither tells you, who muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be called to this Councel, to make the calling law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? <hi>Nor ſecondly,</hi> who muſt of neceſſity be aſſembled, to make the aſſembly full and lawfull? Or how many may ſuffice? <hi>Nor thirdly,</hi> who, or how many of thoſe, who are aſſembled, muſt conſent to the voting of a decree, or definition before it obligeth? <hi>Nor fourhtly,</hi> who muſt call theſe men? Or what power he hath to force them by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to appear at the time, and place appointed, and to continew there? Or whether any one be bound to come, except thoſe who pleaſe, and when they pleaſe? <hi>Nor fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> who muſt preſide in this aſſembly? <hi>Nor ſixtly,</hi> what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer this aſſembly hath to declare all doubts in faith? Or whether it can impoſe precepts vnder paine of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For example, commanding all vnder this penalty to keepe Chriſtmas day, aſſenſion day, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate once a year, to faſt on Chriſtmas Eve, yea to faſt

a whole Lent? Or whether, after all theyr decrees, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, without Sinne, may leave all they command in theſe, or the like matters, quite vndone at his pleaſure? Here you ſee ſix things, all mainly neceſſary to be known by the Church, as a Community; none of the which are plainly tould her in Scripture. Theſe ſixe points, added to the former three, make nine. Let us then proceed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Tenthly, this Community or Church muſt alſo be plainly tould, what publike ſervice her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may, and ought to performe in the Church?

Or whether they may have ſuch an one as is different, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the prime ſubſtance, from all the world; as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion was heretofore? For it cannot but be a thing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importing, in a whole Community, to retaine ſuch or ſuch a publik ſervice as was, at leaſt in ſubſtance, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles; and not to make what changes private men, or nationall Synods pleaſe; nor to diſcard all publik ſervice: Yea, that very ſervice which all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of all Nations, (which were not confeſſed Heretic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes) every where vſed; as appeares by all theyr moſt ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſervice bookes which you could find in any Corner of Chriſtendome. The beginning of the ſubſtantiall things in this Lyturgy, or publick ſervice, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> never be found out, by all diligent ſearch vſed by Proteſtants this laſt hundred yeares; though the time of every litle accidentall change be extant in many records, which would not have failed to record the beginning, of the ſubſtance of the Liturgy, had it had any beginning, different from that common beginning, of all practiſes of Chriſtian Religion brought in by the Apoſtles.</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62436:27"/>8. Eleventhly; the Church is primely concerned in the uſe lawfull or vnlawfull of Sacraments, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore this (as all other things neceſſary for her) ſhould be plainly taught her in Scripture: And yet in all Scripture ſhee can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find the name of Sacrament in this ſenſe which wee, and our adverſaries take it, nor any rule, to direct her to know what a Sacrament is? Or what is required to the lawfull adminiſtration of true Sacraments? which our adverſaries hould to be ſo neceſſary to the true Church, that in theyr <hi>Tenth Article,</hi> they make it one of theyr two certain ſignes and marks, by which the true Church may allwayes be known from the falſe Church; and yet (O prepoſterous proceedings!) they, who will have all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things ſet down plainly in Scripture, know very well that many neceſſary things, concerning the true vſe of Sacraments, be no where expreſſed therein, as no one of thoſe things are which I have now named, nor many other things concerning theyr true vſe; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by whom is every Sacrament neceſſarily to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred? Whether muſt the Miniſters of all Sacraments of neceſſity have any Orders, or none at all? And what order muſt they have? by whom, and in what manner, or in what forme muſt theſe Sacraments be conferred? or whether are wee bound to uſe theſe Sacraments only when wee liſt, and as often, or as ſeldom as wee liſt? For nothing of this point is delivered in Scripture, nor of the other things I juſt now named, whence very many, and very important differences be amongſt vs; all vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidable by Scripture, which is ſo deeply ſilent in all theſe points. Hence ſome of you, for ordering Prieſts and Deacons, require Biſhops ordeyned, and ordeyning with ſuch a forme as never antiquity vſed; And without theſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62436:27"/>
Prieſts, they ſay, there is no lawfull adminiſtring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, at leaſt in publik: Yea, though they hould Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony no Sacrament, yet wee ſee a world make ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about the Lawfulnes of it, except by ordeyned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or at leaſt tickett Miniſters: A thing manifeſtly not expreſſed in Scripture, to which notwithſtanding they all conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nothing to be added. Others therefore farre more conſequently anſwer, that what is not plainly ſet down in Scripture, is thereby ſignified not to be neceſſary; but it is not plainly ſet down in Scripture, that of neceſſity Prieſts are to be ſo ordeyned, or are only to adminiſter Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or that they only ſhould have power to bleſſe the bread: for where is this writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For Chriſt, after he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the wine, ſaid: <hi>Drink you all:</hi> which words import a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to laymen to drink (as you ſay;) why therefore do not theſe words: <hi>Do you this,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne all Lay people as well as your Prieſts, who can ſhew no better authority why they only ſhould bless the bread and wine? You differ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whether the bread of neceſſity muſt be of wheat, or barly? Oats, or peaſe? In baptiſme, ſome will haue ſuch, and ſuch words to be neceſſary; others will allow baptiſme in the name of Chriſt alone; others will ſay no words at all are neceſſary. For (ſay they) when our Saviour would haue his Apoſtles <hi>to ask in his name, Io:</hi> 16.23.24. he is not to be vnderſtood, that of neceſſity they ſhould vſe any words, ſo when he did bidd them <hi>Goe and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father &amp;c. Matt.</hi> 28. he is not neceſſaryly and plainly to be ſo vnderſtood, as if he did bidd them to vſe any words at all, for this is not ſet down in Scripture, and what is not plainly ſet down in Scripture is there by held by you vnneceſſary. Loe here in this number, how many other things haue been ſet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62436:28"/>
down by mee all, ſo neceſſary to the Church, <hi>as a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> and yet not plainly tould her by the Scripture? But let all theſe many things go to make vp an even dozen. This dozen proues twelue times over what I ſayd of the Church taken as a Community.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But moſt of theſe things alſo are neceſſary to be known by ſome peculier ſtates of perſons, wich muſt of neceſſity be in this Community: For in it there muſt be Lawfull Paſtors, who cannot know them ſelues to be lawfull Paſtors, nor carry themſelves for ſuch, vnles they know them ſelves to be ſent by lawfull authority; becauſe (according to your doctrin), the other (and the only other) mark of the true Church, is ſet down <hi>in your tenth Article</hi> to be the true preaching of the word of God. <hi>But how ſhall they preach, vnles they be</hi> (lawfully) <hi>ſent?</hi> Rom. 10.15. They muſt know alſo whether, according to Gods ordinance, any other be theyr Superiours to iudg them, correct them &amp;c. that ſo they may diſcharge theyr duty in obeying them. Thy muſt know the bounds and limits of theyr power over ſome, or all Lay men. They muſt know what theyr duty is to ſee the Decrees of national or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels obſerved, when theſe Councels are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and conſequently they muſt be furniſhed with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes to know the lawfulnes of them: which they can never be, but by knowing thoſe ſix things ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed aboue N. 6, no one of which ſix things are clearly tould them by any Scripture. To theſe Paſtors alſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to performe the publick ſervice in due manner, and to teach the people when they are bound to aſſiſt at it; and conſequently they, of neceſſity, muſt be tould which is the publick ſervice vſed by the Apoſtles, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theyr ſucceſſors inſtructed by them to vſe it. For who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62436:28"/>
they vſed none at all, though what they vſed bee no otherwiſe written then in the publick Practiſe of, not one, but as many Nations as they converted; all which vſed Lyturgies conteyning the eſſence and ſubſtance of a true ſacrifice. Theſe Paſtors alſo muſt know all that in the laſt number wee ſaid to belong to the wholy neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge of true Sacraments: they muſt know, for example, whether they may permit woemen to baptize, in caſe of neceſſity; as I ſhall ſhew all antiquity to have held and practiſed, though there be no ſuch thing clearly ſet down in Scripture; And ſo for other things. And Thus much for Clergy men, and theyr ſtate. Marriage is alſo a ſtate of millions of lay men, and to which ſo many of them, not yet married, doe pretend: now ſome things vnder pain of damnation muſt be practiced, and conſequently known, by theſe men, which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tould them in Scripture: as whether they may have two wives, or no, at one time? wee all hould this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet this obligation of having but one (ſo hard to many) is no where clearly, and manifeſtly ſet down in any Scripture: Secondly, it is damnable to them to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſuch and ſuch degrees of kindred, as wee all hould; where be theſe degrees cleerly tould vs in the new Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If wee are to practice what is in the ould Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men may, at once, have one or more wives; againſt which you have no clear Text in all the new Teſtament. I might add that it is neceſſary, to thoſe who marry, to know whether it be lawfull to do ſo without a Prieſt, there being no ſuch thing intimated in Scripture; according to which holy and miſterious things are known to have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed by the Miniſtery of Laymen. For the killing of the Paſchall Lamb was both holy and miſterious,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62436:29"/>
and yet done by Lay men. Why may not then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be performed without a Prieſt? Adde now theſe two or three things to the former dozen, and you have at leaſt fourteen ſeverall things, the knowledge of which are all neceſſary to men of ſeverall ſtates in the Church; and yet no where ſet down in plain Scripture. I ſay here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the obligation which parents have, to ſend theyr children to be baptized in due time; becauſe of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of baptizing children wee ſhall ſpeak hearafter ſect. 8. n. 3. as alſo of ſending them to ſuch who can law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adminiſter Baptiſme; of which I haue ſaid ſome thing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, ſpeaking of all in generall, whatſoever they be, many of the things now ſpecified muſt, under paine of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be known by them, that they may prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice theyr neceſſary dutie which obligeth all and every one to be of a Church which hath lawfull Paſtors, and which hath lawfull Prieſts, Ordeyned, with the matter and forme which is neceſſary, by true Biſhops, and not falſe ones; and the Preachers of which Church muſt have true miſſion. All muſt know alſo, how farre they are bound to obey theſe theyr lawfull Paſtors, both with interior ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſome caſes, and alſo exterior co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity, in others. They all muſt know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be of a Church where God is publickly ſerved, with that publick ſervice which the Apoſtles brought into the Church, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theyr ſucceſſors. Every one is bound not to work vpon the Sundayes, as wee will ſhew, though neither this, nor yet many other things (of which wee ſhall ſpeake in many of the next ſections) be plainly ſet down in any Scripture. Here wee haue had above 14. of theſe things ſpecified, only for the full declaration of theſe words;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62436:29"/>
                     <hi>Neceſſary to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> all which you ſay are plainly ſet down in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Let vs now declare theſe words, <hi>plainly ſet down in Scripture;</hi> that all may plainly ſee how many more great new difficulties ſpring from them. <hi>The firſt difficulty</hi> (clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no plain Scripture) is, whether the Book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which ſuch a point is ſet down, be Gods word, or no; as when it is written in the book of Toby, Iudith, the Machabees, the Apocalips? <hi>The ſecond difficulty,</hi> cleared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by no plain Scripture, is whether, though ſuch a book be Gods word; yet I be ſecured, that it hath not been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the Chapter, or verſe, expreſſing the point in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſy. <hi>The third difficulty,</hi> cleared plainly by no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, that theſe words, on which the controverſy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, be infallibly taken in this place in theyr Common and vſuall ſenſe, or perhaps taken figuratively, or ſpoken miſtically of ſome other thing. For how is it poſſible, by Scripture only, to come to have an infallible knowledge of this, on which the controverſy wholy depends? beeing this dependeth meerly on the inward free will of God, who perhaps would vſe o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the plain vulgar ſenſe of theſe words in this place, perhaps would vſe them only figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively, or only myſtically. To know this ſecret free will of God, and that infallibly, I muſt have ſuch a Reuelation, or ſuch an aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, as you will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to the Church repreſented in a Councel, and therefore it cannot prudently be allowable to any private man: neither can any private man ſhew plaine Scripture for his particular pretence, to know infallibly this ſecret will of God. A <hi>fourth difficulty</hi> (not to be cleared by plaine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is, that after I have peruſed the whole Scripture, purpoſely to know what I am bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of neceſſity to believe,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62436:30"/>
and do, for my Salvation; I find no where plainly tould mee, that I am only to believe, and do that only which is plainly tould mee in Scripture: ſo that perhaps I may be bound both to believe, and do, ſomewhat not expreſſed clearly in Scripture, eſpecially it not beeing clear, plain, and manifeſt by Scripture, that I am not to hear the Church, nor admitt of vnwritten traditions, but ſtand only to what is written. But of theſe <hi>fower</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties wee ſhall ſpeak fully in the following Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now wee muſt conſider how theſe words, <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture,</hi> be yet liable to <hi>a fifth difficulty;</hi> which is, that men of quite contrary perſwaſions in faith, ſay, that ſuch a text ſayth plainly this; an other ſayth, that it ſayth plainly no ſuch thing; yea, that it ſayth the plain contrary: witnes thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which, as you bring it about, muſt plainly ſignify, <hi>this is not my Body.</hi> And, thus we contend whether Scripture be plaine and cleare? which makes it plaine and clear, that Scripture, though ſubmitted to by vs both, endeth neither of our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in moſt important matters.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>A ſixth difficulty</hi> (and a moſt fruictfull Mother of a number of difficulties) ariſeth from your own explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and declarations, and modifications, and limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as good as annihilations, by which you ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain this principle; which you ſtrain ſo much at other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, to make it reach home to all points neceſſary, by a clear deciſion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, euen in any neceſſary controverſy. Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi> with whoſe words I began this Section, tells vs, that all things neceſſary are not ſo plainly ſet down, that every one who reades Scripture, can manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw out of it the knowledge of all points that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62436:30"/>
but (ſayth he) <hi>it is enough, if it be done by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi> So litle plain dealing there is in calling, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling that thing <hi>plain;</hi> which plainly proveth it ſelfe not to be ſo, by not beeing <hi>plain</hi> to any, who are not as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men as theyr Miniſters. All woemen (who ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly read, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cite the bible) may now deſpaire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by theyr own reading, even thoſe very things which are neceſſary to ſalvation. This, they now tell you, muſt be done for you by Miniſters, from whom if you will have it, you muſt take it on theyr word: For you are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate if you tell them theyr plain deductions be not plain, nor conformable to Scripture; though you may be one of the elect, and yet ſay ſo much againſt what whole generall Councels have deduced from Scripture. But this which they would have you beleeve to be plainly ſet down, they tell you cannot be found out to be ſo by all kind of Miniſters, <hi>but only by ſuch</hi> (point them out with your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if you can) as vſe all theſe things following. 1. <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2. <hi>Diligence in ſearch of the Scripture,</hi> 3. <hi>Collation of places,</hi> 4. <hi>Obſerving the connexions,</hi> 5. <hi>Sincerity and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi> 6. <hi>Prayer ard Devotion for aſsiſtance in the work.</hi> To all which you muſt ever put this <hi>Notandum,</hi> that neither you can tell, when they have vſed theſe things ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to come to the plain and wholy neceſſary truth; nor they can tell whether there hath not creapt in ſome error in the vſe of theſe meanes, ſpoiling all. Neither will the vſe of theſe only ſuffice: Skill in Greek, and deepe skill, is required for pervſing the new Teſtament, and no leſſe skill in Hebrew for the ould. To theſe, ſtill fallible Rules, ſo many more are to be added out of your own Divines, that your great Divine <hi>Sanchius</hi> (de Sacra Scriptura <hi>Col.</hi> 409.) aſſigneth no fewer then <hi>Nineteene Rules,</hi> beſides the

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He force of this Argument breefly is this. If Scripture were our only Rule of beleefe, it would tell us all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryly to be believed: It doth not tell vs what bookes be the only true word of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62436:32"/>
God; which is a point moſt neceſſary to be beleeved: It is not therefore our only Rule of beliefe: Here you ſee a <hi>fifthteeth</hi> neceſſary, and moſt neceſſary point, not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down in Scripture. <hi>Luther</hi> denyeth the <hi>Apocalyps, the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, the Epiſtle of S. Iames,</hi> and other parts of Scripture, to be true Scripture what text tells him plainly he muſt beleeve the contrary? Wee hould ſome halfe a ſcore bookes to be true Scripture, which you hould <hi>Apocrypha:</hi> what Scripture, or one ſingle ſyllable of Scripture, tells vs wee hould falſe, and you true? Cite that text, and wee yeeld. If you cannot cite that text, then yeeld your ſelves to beleeve many, and ſo, very many, parts of Scripture to be Gods word, which by no one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle text of Scripture, you can prove to be ſo. Tell mee then, I pray, tell mee, as you tender your own and my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, vpon what ground you beleeve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſo? You beleeue all things for the ſaying of true Scripture: Why do you beleeve the Scripture to be Scripture and Gods word? Not upon any text, for you have not one: And yet you beleeue this infallibly. What other ground have you, beſides texts of Scripture, able to ſupport an infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe? Is the tradition of the Church to be relied vpon in ſo great a matter? Then much more may it be relyed vpon in leſſer matters. But if ſhee be fallible in the delivery of her traditions, how can I, vpon her authority, ground an infallible aſſent to the beleefe of all the books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beeing Gods certain word? For this is a very hard point, becauſe many of them contein things of them ſelves very incredible, as that, the perſonality of God the Father ſhould be all one thing with the divine eſſence; and that, the perſonality of God the Sonne ſhould not be all one thing with the perſonality of God the Father;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62436:32"/>
and yet be all one thing with the divine eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is all one thing with the perſonality of God the Father. That the ſerpent ſhould ſpeak to Eve: that all the world ſhould be excluded Heaven for one mans eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apple. Is not that authority, which is able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the infallible beleefe of Books, which contain things ſo hard to beleeve, able alſo to ſupport the infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of things farre leſſe incredible, as Purgatory, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſaincts, an inferior worſhip of Images in reſpect of the perſons they repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?

For ſayth he ſect. 13. <hi>Wee ſay the Scripture conteyns all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall objects of fayth neceſſary to Salvation, that is, All things that had been neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe and do, though there had been no Scriptures.</hi> Whence ſect. 24. he, out of this principle, anſwers my objection thus; <hi>That to believe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the word of God, is not of thoſe materiall objects of faith which wee ſay are conteyned in Scripture, and are ſuch as had been neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe though there had been no Scripture.</hi> And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he proueth the impoſſibility, that there is, that Scripture ſhould ſufficiently tell vs which Bookes be infallible Gods word: and that, therefore wee muſt ſuppoſe vniverſall Tradition ſtill to bring it down
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62436:33"/>
to vs. But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. you mark not how pittifully you vndoe that very prime doctrine of yours, which forceth you all to maintayne, that all things neceſſary are plainly ſet down in Scripture, to witt; That (according to you) Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given vs by God, to be our only direction, in all that wee muſt neceſſarily believe and do for Salvation; for if this doctrine muſt paſſe among all for ſo very true, that it muſt be imbraced by the beliefe of all, before they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſely ſay; <hi>In this Bible only wee are to find all neceſſary truth;</hi> It followeth then moſt vndoubtedly vpon Gods giving vs the Bible, to be taken by vs as our only Rule, that there muſt needs ariſe a neceſſity of our believing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which wee ſhould not have been bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if there had been no Scripture written. For there muſt ariſe a neceſſity of believing this very doctrine of yours, that the written word of God is given vs for our only direction in the points aforeſaid, Or elſe no man is bound to believe this, and to admitt of Scripture only for his Rule. For nothing can be more ſure, then that this doctrine hath not vniuerſall Tradition, ſtill to bring it down to vs: Therefore either this doctrine is moſt falſe, (as really it is:) or moſt falſe it is that wee vpon the writing of Scripture, are only obliged to believe that, to the beliefe of which wee ſhould only have been obliged though there had been no Scripture. For what ſay you to this argument. True faith is neceſſary to Salvation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only Rule guiding vs to true faith, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be known aſſuredly by vs: Becauſe, without the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Rule wee have no aſſured meanes (as you ſay) to true faith: But the only true Bookes of Scripture, are the only Rule guiding vs to true faith; as you all teach: therefore wee muſt have an infallible aſſurance of theſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62436:33"/>
true Bookes. Again, the more impoſſible it is for Scripture to informe vs ſufficiently which Bookes be Scripture, which not, and that infallibly; the more certain it is, that iuſt as this moſt important point of all points, and the hardeſt of them all (for it conteyneth all the points that are moſt hard in our faith) can be made infalliby aſſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs without Scripture, ſo other points alſo may bee; as Purgatory, Prayer to ſaints &amp;c? and therefore theſe other leſſe hard points may be, as infallibly, by the Tradition of the ſame Church, aſſecured vnto vs. For if tradition can ſupport an infallible aſſent to the hardeſt points, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the like aſſent to the leſſe hard. He that can carry a hundred pound weight, can carry three or fowerſcore pound weight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it is that <hi>D. Fern,</hi> in the ſame place, is forced to fly to that paradoxicall opinion, to which nothing, but deſperation of eſcaping any other way, hath driven him and his Proteſtant bretheren. Thus then he ſayth; <hi>Scripture beeing received vpon ſuch tradition, it diſcouers it ſelfe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine by its own light, or thoſe internall arguments which appear in it to thoſe who are verſed in it.</hi> Which others expreſſe thus; the Canonicall Books are worthy to be believed for them ſelves; as wee aſſent to the firſt principles by theyr own light, ſo wee do aſſent to Scripture to be the word of God, through the help of the Spirit of God; as by its own light The Canonicall Bookes beare witnes of them ſelves, they carry theyr own light, by which wee may ſee them to be Gods word: as wee ſee the ſunne, to be the ſunne, by his own light; ſo they.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wee muſt then firſt ſpeake a word of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which <hi>D. Fern</hi> called <hi>vniuerſall Tradition,</hi> that is the tradition of the whole Church, which you all ſay is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62436:34"/>
fallible, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo you muſt not reſt vpon it with an infallible aſſent, but take it as a prudent motive perſwading ſuch Bookes, as you hould to be Canonicall, to be Gods word, which you believe to be ſo for it ſelfe. But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. it is moſt falſe that <hi>vniuerſall Tradition</hi> hath delivered iuſt that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bookes, and thoſe Bookes, which you hould to belong to the true Canon. The Councel of Laodicea (in which you vſe to boaſt your Canon to be conteyned) omitteth the Apocalyps or Revelations, and, beſides <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi> you will not find one ancient writer who eyther putteth not fewer or more Bookes in the Canon then you do. Our Canon you deny, and diſcard ſome halfe a ſcore Bookes out of it. Yet ours is the only Canon which can claime a ſufficient Tradition, as I ſhall here ſhew Num. 11. And as for the Councel of Laodicea, it is farre from beeing againſt us, for it defines in deed ſuch Bookes to belong to the Canon of Scripture: but it doth not exclude any one of thoſe which alſo afterward, when due examen was made, were found delivered, if not with as full, yet with a Tradition ſufficientlyfull; as you may ſee in the third Councel of Carthage, to which <hi>S. Auſten</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in perſon. An evident Proof of this is, that the <hi>Sixth</hi> Generall Councel doth confirme both this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Laodicea, and that very Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Carthage, which by name defined all the Bookes, ſet down in our Canon, to be Gods word: ſee Num. 11. And then tell mee with what face you can ſo much as pretend to <hi>vniuerſall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for admitting your Bible a Bible putting among the Apocrypha ſo many Bookes, flatly againſt the tradition of the precedent 12. hundered yeares. If this Tradition be a prudent inducement to imbrace what it commendeth, then it induceth vs to imbrace halfe a ſcore Bookes more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62436:34"/>
then you putt in your Canon: If it be not a prudent indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement, it helpeth you nothing. If you fly to the tradition of the Church only of the firſt four hundered yeares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Councel of Carthage, iuſt after the end of thoſe yeares, alledged the <hi>ancient Tradition of theyr Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> which they iudged ſufficient for defining our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. They, who were ſo neere thoſe firſt four hundered years, knew far better the more vniverſall Tradition of that age, then wee can 12. hundered yeares after it. True it is (nothing beeing defined as then) privat Doctors were free to follow what they iudged to be trueſt: and as you find them varying from our canon, ſome in ſome bookes, ſome in others; ſo you will finde them varying from one an other, and varying alſo from you. For in thoſe firſt four hundered yeares <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> excluded the book of <hi>Eſter,</hi> which you adde. <hi>Origen</hi> doubts of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, of the ſecond of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> of the firſt and ſecond of <hi>S. Iohn. S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> leave the Apocalyps or Revelations out of theyr Canon. <hi>Euſebius</hi> doubteth of it. Only <hi>Rufinus</hi> aggreeth iuſt with you. <hi>Doth he make alone a ſufficiently vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Tradition from Chriſts time to this?</hi> Now then all of you, by refuſing the Canon commended by the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church; are left to the ſagacity of your own noſes, to hunt out that moſt important and infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth of the true Canon of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Here wee muſt examin what help you will have by the true Bookes of Scripture, which you ſay carry theyr own light with them, by which they may be as clearly ſeen to be Gods word, as the Sunn by his own light. For to the truth of this ſtrange Paradox, explicated as aboue, you have brought the whole ſubſtance of your faith, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62436:35"/>
muſt all fall to the ground, to be trodden vpon by the Socinians, if this groundles ground houlds not ſure: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you believe all other particular points relying vpon Scripture only; All the Scripture you believe relying on this ground only, that you know by the very reading of ſuch a booke, that this booke is as evidently Gods word, by a certain light which the reading of it (with Spirit) produceth, as you ſee the Sun by his light. Indeed you have brought your Religion to as pittifull a caſe as your greateſt enemies could wiſh it in.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Firſt then this ground (vpon which you ground all) is accounted a plaine fooliſh ground, by your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> I ſay, your own, for the moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of both your vniverſities have owned, and higly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified his booke, notwithſtanding his ſcornfull language concerning this ground of your whole Religion. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi> then (p. 69. n. 49.) anſwering theſe words of his adverſary. <hi>That the divinity of a writing cannot be known by it ſelfe alone, but by ſome intrinſecall authority:</hi> replyeth thus; <hi>This you need not proue: for no wiſe man denyeth it.</hi> And <hi>M. Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> (eſteemed <hi>the learnedeſt Proteſtant which ever putt penne to paper</hi>) writeth thus; <hi>Of things neceſſary, the very cheifeſt is to know what Bookes wee are to eſteeme holy, which point is confeſſed impoſſible for the Scripture it ſelfe to teach.</hi> So he Eccl. Pol: L. 1. S. 14. Pag. 86. And <hi>D. Covel</hi> in his defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, Art. 4 P. 31. <hi>It is not the word of God which doth or can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that wee do well to think it the word of God.</hi> Yet that which ſuch men as theſe hould impoſſible, and a meer Chymaera, or phanſy, which <hi>no wiſe man would hould,</hi> you hould to be as evident as the ſunne beeing ſeen by its own light; as evident as the firſt Principles, which are ſo evident of themſelves that they need no proofe, but are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62436:35"/>
clearer then any thing you can bring to proue them. For example <hi>That the whole is greater then any part. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any thing ſhould be ſo, and not be ſo, iuſt in the ſame circumſtances &amp;c.</hi> Do you think any rationall man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is thus evident that <hi>S. Matthewes</hi> Ghoſpel (for example) is the true word of God, by the only reading of it, to him, who did not before read this verity? Doe not all euidently ſee, that there is no ſuch evidence to be ſeen? About the truth of firſt Principles no man ever doubted, or could doubt; about <hi>S. Matthewes</hi> Ghoſpel the Manicheans, Marcioniſtes, Cerdoniſts &amp;c. did not only doubt, but flatly reiected it. And incomparable more doubt hath been made of other parts of Scripture, as wee have ſeen, and ſhall yet further ſee. Sometimes indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call Scripture <hi>the firſt Principle, an vndoubted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a moſt known and certain Principle,</hi> Not that it is ſo for any evidence it carryeth with it ſelfe, manifeſtly ſhewing it to be ſo: But the Scripture is ſayd to be ſuch a Principle among vs Chriſtians, becauſe all of vs now admitt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as of vnqueſtionable and infallible truth. Vpon this <hi>Suppoſition</hi> (evidently graunted by vs all) wee all, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing with one an other, ſtill <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> and take for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Principle, that the Scripture is Gods infallible word But this doth <hi>only ſuppoſe,</hi> and not proue this truth, even ſo much as to our own Conciences, that Scripture is the vndoubted word of God, which it cannot ſhew it ſelfe infallibly to be, by the only reading of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Secondly there be many millions who can moſt truly and ſincerly proteſt before God, and take it vpon theyr Salvation, that they are wholy vnable, by the meer reading of the bookes of Scripture (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62436:36"/>
the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes &amp;c) to come to an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurance that they be Gods word, to which aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, even your admirable <hi>Luther,</hi> and his moſt learned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, never came: For they all reiect theſe, and other Bookes admitted for Gods infallible word by you. Now good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. tell mee what meanes hath God provided to bring vs (who have not theſe new eyes, requiſite to ſee the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine you ſpeake of) or to bring your Lutheran Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren who will be confeſſed not to want the true Spirit (for they had the firſt fruits of the ſpirit in the bleſſed worke of your Reformation) what meanes, I ſay hath God provided to bring them and vs, to this infallible aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by which wee are all obliged, vnder pain of damnation, to believe the Scripture to be Gods word?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Thirdly; how comes it to paſſe, that the Preachers of the Church find that concurrance of Gods grace, in delivering the verities conteyned in the Scripture to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathens, that millions of them have been thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: but no ſingle Man is reported (as farre as I know) to have found ſuch concurrance by only reading the written word, as thereby to have been illuminated with the beliefe of Scripture? How cometh this about, if the divinity thereof be to the reader (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is as well diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the hearer) no leſſe evident then the broad Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine? Doth not this ſhew that it is true which wee teach, that theſe internall Arguments are only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered after the Scripture is accepted for Gods word, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not before, as the Cauſe of accepting it for ſuch?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Fourthly; as the Scripture is the only ground, vpon which you build your beliefe of all other things; ſo this divine light (diſcouered to you by reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is the only ground, vpon which you believe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62436:36"/>
and conſequently all other things which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. This ground then is the ground of all true faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your doctrine. If it be ſo; how is it poſſible that the greateſt Doctors that ever God placed in the Church to the edifying the ſame, vpon no one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle occaſion (having ſo continuall occaſions) do ſo much, as once at leaſt profeſſe themſelves to believe ſuch or ſuch a book to be Gods word, becauſe they, by the reading of it (which was theyr dayly and nightly work) did diſcouer ſuch divine rayes, or ſuch internall arguments appearing in it, to thoſe who were verſed in it; as <hi>D. Ferne</hi> ſpeaketh? Neiher do any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> give, ſo much as once, this for a reaſon why they doubted of, or admitted not ſuch, and ſuch books, about which (before the definition of the Church) there were ſo frequent Controverſies, meerly becauſe they could not diſcouer this light, or theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall arguments Did theſe Men want the ſpirit of God, even in the foundation of all true belief? Yea, had not theſe Men of all others the moſt obſerving eyes, and the moſt irradiated vnderſtandings which ſo many ages have brought forth? This argument falleth heavier vpon <hi>D. Ferne,</hi> and thoſe who like his doctrine, then vpon any other. For Sect. 7. hauing vndertaken to ſhew, <hi>that Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot make the plea which Proteſtants make;</hi> he proueth this by this Principle: That Sectaries do not pretend to confirme what they ſay by <hi>practice of antiquity as Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants do,</hi> according to <hi>D. Ferne</hi> and <hi>Doct. Hen. Hammond.</hi> But O great Doctor I pray, if you can, ſhew us but one ſmall ſcrappe of antiquity for this your fundamentall Doctrine: For ſurely this moſt imports in the very groundwork of faith. And (to vſe your own ſo often ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated argument) your part beeing the affirmative, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62436:37"/>
a maine differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Sectaries (ariſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your adhering cloſe to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiquity) you are obliged to do this, at leaſt where it ſo imports, as it doth in the beliefe of that vpon which you beleeve all what ſoeuer you believe. Againe, if you be ſo good at finding out aſſuredly Gods true word, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his falſe word, meerly by this your ſharp eye ſight, you might do notable ſervice to thoſe who now at Londen ſet forth the moſt famous Bible that ever as yet (as they ſay) did ſee light. For you could tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly which were the true Coppies of the true Originals, which not; whearas thoſe ſhort ſighted Doctors do open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe them ſelves to ſweat at this by indefatigable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in conferring every verſe with ſeuerall Coppies, and then culling out that which agreeth with the moſt and beſt Copies. To this induſtry they Profeſſe themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to truſt, and not to that pretended light, though you make it the ground of all your faith. See the next Sect. n. 8.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Fiftly; I argue thus, Take the Book of <hi>Baruch,</hi> (which you hould not to be Gods word) in the one hand, and the Book of <hi>Micheas</hi> in the other hand; this Book hath ſeven Chapters: Now I challenge you, if you can, to tell mee that Chapter, or the part of that Chapter in any one of theſe ſeven Chapters, which hath more divine rayes, or internall arguments for the holines of it, then appear in the ſix Chapters of the book of <hi>Baruch.</hi> Your part is the affirmatiue, affirming that there be ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall arguments, and ſuch evidences, and that there be more of them in the one, then in the other: Shew mee but one of them, or elſe you will ſhew your ſelves to the world to vent your owne phanſies, for grounds of beleefe, even in the moſt important points of beleefe. So I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62436:37"/>
take the book of <hi>Toby,</hi> take the book of <hi>Iudith,</hi> which you reject for Apocryphall, as not carrying with them a divine light, and thoſe internall arguments: take (I ſay) eyther of theſe books, and read it over, and be as well verſed in it as you are in the book of Numbers, for example; and ſee if it be poſſible for you, with all the help your Brethren can afford you, to point out any one Chapter, verſe, or word in the book of Numbers, carrying with it more divine rayes, or better internall arguments, then appear in either of the bookes I named. What would you have vs do with our eyes, to keepe vs from ſeeing how clearly this is impoſſible vnto you; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheles ſhould be moſt eaſy, if your opinion were true, or any thing like to true. For theſe divine rayes (ſay you) carry an evidence of ſo high a degree, that you doe not only beleeue (as wee poore folkes do) but you doe know theſe bookes to be divine: and this you know with a moſt infallible knowledge, produced by the evidence carried in the clear Sunneſhine of this Light, and theſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous internall arguments making it no leſſe apparent then the firſt Principles.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Sixtly if any one verſe, or any one ſmall word, changing the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt (eſpecially this litle word, <hi>Not</hi>) beleft out in any one Chapter, eyther through ignorance, malice or careleſness of thoſe writers (whoſe Coppies our printed Bibles have followed;) whom will you be able to make beleeve, that you are ſo ſharpe-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to ſee this ſmall omiſſion, and that by a light ſuffice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an infallible beleefe of it appearing to you only by the reading that place. And yet this you muſt do to diſtinguiſh the true word of God from the falſe. But how farre all of you are from doing this, I will now declare:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62436:38"/>
All the dayes of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> your Bibles did read in the 105. Pſalm. v. 28. <hi>they were not obedient,</hi> contrary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the true text; which hath, <hi>They were not diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or rebelled not againſt his words,</hi> as now you read it. Theſe, and two hundered more Corruptions in the true Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, you did ſing dayly. And who was there who did ſee in what places theſe corruptions were? Yea the Queen, then head of the Church, made her Clergy ſubſcribe that all theſe corruptions were Gods own word. See the 5. <hi>Sect. num.</hi> 4. whence appears that you cannot ſmell out theſe Corruptions; of which I ſhall ſay more in the place cited. They then of your Religion beleeve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon no ground which is not fallible, and which may not really be falſe as this light may be; and therefore it ſufficeth not to a divine faith: and ſo you have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible beliefe aſſuring you, that this book is Gods word; whence all that is in that book hath no divine authority, of which you are aſſured. And thus, moſt pittifully, all of you are deſtitute of divine faith, in all points you beleeue; becauſe you beleeve them all vpon the authority of thoſe bookes, which you, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noe infallible ground, can beleeve to be divine. See here how you, who boaſt of Scripture ſo much, come, by rejecting the Church, not to beleeue the Scripture it ſelfe with any divine faith; but only with ſuch human perſwaſion as may be falſe, becauſe it is fallible, hauing no infallible ground to ſtand vpon. Hence it is that your famous <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> having witt enough to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the vngroundednes of this ground, and not having grace enough to ſet ſure footing vpon that firme rocke of the true Church, in plain tearmes comes to defend (<hi>P.</hi> 327.) it to be ſufficient to beleeve Scripture with noe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of aſſent, then wee beleeve, <hi>That there is ſuch a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62436:38"/>
citty as Conſtantinople, or the Hiſtory of Caeſar and Saluſt.</hi> Whence the ground of his beleefe of the Scripture (vpon whoſe authority only he beleeveth all other things) beeing thus confeſſedly found to be human, and to have nothing of divine faith: he is forced to ſay (<hi>P.</hi> 159.) <hi>Wee have, I beleeve, as great reaſon to beleeve, That there was ſuch a Man as Henry the Eight King of England, as that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered vnder Pontius Pilate.</hi> Is this a book to be owned by the prime Doctors of both vniverſities, and to be ſo vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally cryed vp by our Nation? <hi>Dear Ieſu!</hi> to what times were wee come? No wonder that theſe times are now come to vs.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Seventhly; I further ſhew the manifeſt falſity of your doctrine, by vnanſwerable experience, confirming what now I ſayd <hi>Nu.</hi> 9. <hi>Luther</hi> (a man acknowledged by common conſent of Engliſh Divines, to have had Gods Spirit in a very Large meaſure) did read the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames,</hi> and he held it to be an Epiſtle of Straw <hi>Praefat: in Nov. Teſt.</hi> and his cheefe diſciple <hi>Pomeranus,</hi> vpon the fourth Chapter to the Romans, ſayth: <hi>Out of this place you may diſcover the error of the Epiſtle of Iames, in which you ſee a wicked argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: moreover he ridiculouſly deduceth his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: he citeth</hi> (ſayth this fellow) <hi>Scripture againſt Scripture.</hi> But I go on with <hi>Luther,</hi> he did read the Apocalyps, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for all the light and internall arguments he could diſcouer in it, he thought <hi>it not written with an Apoſtolicall Spirit.</hi> All our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Devines read theſe ſelfe ſame bookes, and there is not one of them, nor of theyr diſciples, ſo ill-ſighted, but they can diſcouer a light no leſſe clearly ſhewing theſe Bookes to be Gods infallible word, then the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſheweth him ſelfe to be the Sunne by his light; they all ſee internall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62436:39"/>
arguments ſufficeing to an infallible aſſent of the quite contrary verity. But how can that ground be but falſe which groundeth plain Contradictions? If you reply, that <hi>Luthers</hi> not ſeeing ſuch Bookes to be Canonicall, is only a negative argument of ſmall force. I anſwer, that, where things are affirmed to be as evident as the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhine, and as clear as the firſt principles: and that theſe things, affirmed by you to be ſo clear, are alſo dayly ſet before the eyes of a man ſo well ſeeing, as <hi>Luther,</hi> and his prime diſciples were; and yet, that neither he, nor his prime diſciples, ſhould euer be able to ſee this light (though theyr ſharp-ſighted eyes ſo often laboured to diſcouer it:) this cannot be but a certain ſigne that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe men were pittifully blind, or that you miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably phanſy ſuch a light to ſhine in the very reading of the Apocalyps, the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, the Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iames</hi> &amp;c. Is it a weak argument to ſay; I have been in the hall on ſet purpoſe to ſee if there were a Candle ſet vp lighted there, and I could ſee none, though I moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavored to ſee it, and had my eyes about mee; therefore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude there is no light ſet vp there? I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude alſo that eyther I, who ſay this, am blinde; or you, who ſay there is ſuch a light, are manifeſtly deluded by a falſe fanſy of your own? And I can alſo make my argument as ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the affirmative, as in the negative. I do it thus; <hi>S. Auſten</hi> (the moſt ſharpe-ſighted ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Church hath had) a man confeſſedly indued with the true ſpirit; and a man of your own Religion, as you will ſay; and conſequently a man agreeing with you in that doctrine, on which all your whole beleef is built; to witt, that true Scriptures were infallibly believed to be Gods word, becauſe they were diſcouered in the very reading of them to be ſo, by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62436:39"/>
a divine light, and by internall arguments ſufficeing to ground an infallible aſſent to this verity; this man, I ſay, and the whole third Councel of Carthage together with him, did believe that all and every one of thoſe bookes, which wee believe to be Canonicall and divine, to be ſo indeed; and to be propounded to be ſo to the people. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould here, as good eyes, as you can pretend to have, reading theſe bookes, and beleeving them infallibly to be divine: which they could not do (according to your doctrine) but by diſcouering in them a divine light, ſhewing this truth evidently, and by ſuch internall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as ſuffice to infallibility. Therefore theſe books, (ſeen ſo infallibly to be divine) are indeed ſo: and you muſt graunt them to be ſo, and not to be Apocryphall, as you hould them; or elſe you muſt graunt, that <hi>S. Auſten</hi> and the Fathers of the Councel of Carthage and all the Fathers, who ever after this Councel held this our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, did not agree with you in the prime principle of your Religion, teaching that there is no infallible ground to believe ſuch and ſuch bookes to be Gods word, but that diuine light appearing in the reading of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch Readers as they were. For if they agreed with you in this principle, then they did conceive themſelves to diſcouer this divine light in thoſe very books, which you call Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall, as well as in the other, which you hould Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall: And if they all were deceiued by this principle, in thoſe bookes; then you may be deceiued in all the other, becauſe your only grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for theyr beeing divine, is hence cleerly proued to be fallible and falſe, and moſt vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ground an infallible beliefe: But you have noe other faith, then that which reſteth wholy on this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; Therefore all the faith you have is fallible. And if any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62436:40"/>
one obiect that <hi>S. Ierom,</hi> (as great a Doctor in point of the knowledge of the Scriptures as <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>) did not hould the Bookes of the Machabees for Gods word, which <hi>S. Auſten</hi> helde to be Gods word: therefore one of them relied on a fallible ground; why not <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> as well as <hi>S. Ierom?</hi> I anſwer, that even from hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that neyther of theſe two (though the moſt Eagle-ſighted Doctors that ever the Church had) did make the ground of theyr receiuing or reiecting books for true or falſe Scripture, to be any ſuch divine light, appearing to ſuch readers as both they were: For then they could not have helde quite contrary one to an other; as I ſayd of the Lutherans and you. The true reaſon, why theſe two great Doctors were of contrary opinions concerning theſe bookes, as alſo divers other holy Fathers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning diuers other bookes, (which had bin impoſſible if the evidence of true Scripture had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo great as you make it;) the true reaſon, I ſay, was, that as yet the Church of Chriſt had not defined which Bookes were Gods true word, which not: wherefore, then it was free to doubt of ſuch bookes as were not admitted by ſuch a Tradition of the Church, as was evidently ſo vniuerſall, that it was cleerly ſufficient to ground an infallible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. For all thoſe holy Fathers agreed ever in this, that ſuch bookes were evidently Gods word which had evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a ſufficient tradition for them; Now in the dayes of thoſe Fathers, who thus varied from one an other, it was not by any infallible meanes made known to all, that thoſe books (about which all theyr variance was) were recommended for Gods infallible word, by a tradition clearly ſufficient to ground beliefe: for the Church had not as yet examined and defined, whether Tradition did
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62436:40"/>
clearly enough ſhew ſuch, and ſuch books, to be Gods infallible word. But in the dayes of <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> the thirde Councel of Carthage Anno 397. examined how ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, or vnſufficient the Tradition of the Church was, which recommended thoſe Bookes for Scripture, about which there was ſo much doubt and contrariety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. They found all the Bookes conteyned in our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non (of which you account ſo many Apocryphall) to have been recommended by a Tradition, ſufficient to ground faith vpon. For on this ground (Can. 47.) they proceeded in defining all the bookes in our Canon to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>wee have receiued from our Fathers that theſe Bookes were to be read in the Church.</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt (who liued Anno 402.) beeing requeſted by <hi>Exuperius,</hi> Biſhop of Toloufe, to declare vnto him which Bookes were Canonicall, he anſwereth Ep. 3. that hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined what ſufficient Tradition did demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>Quid cuſtodita ſeries temporum demonſtraret,</hi> in the end of his Epiſtle c. 7. he ſetteth down, <hi>Qui libri recipiantus in Canone Sanctarum Scripturarum. What bookes are receiued in the Canon of the holy Scriptures.</hi> To witt juſt thoſe which wee now have in our Canon: and though he rejecteth many other Bookes, yet he rejecteth not one of theſe. So that after theſe declarations of the ſufficiency of this Tradition, no one ever pertinaciouſly diſſented from it, but ſuch, as Proteſtants themſelves do confeſſe to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes; vntill the dayes of Luther, who preſumed to call Apocryphall, not only thoſe Bookes which you count to be ſo, but alſo divers others; as I ſhewed here nu. 1. Hence from the time of the Councel of Carthage, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the firſt, all in theyr dayly citations of Scripture, vntill the dayes of <hi>Luther,</hi> held thoſe very bookes to be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62436:41"/>
Gods word which wee hould to be, and were defined by them to be held to be ſo vpon tradition duly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; And this within four hundred yeares after Chriſt, yet after the time of <hi>S. Ierom.</hi> Now after this was done, there comes <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> and ſetts down all theſe bookes for Canonicall <hi>Lib. de doctrina Chriſtiana c.</hi> 8. After him comes <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the Pope (who lived Anno 492.) and confirmes the ſame Canon. After him comes the Sixt generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel celebrated Anno 680. which in the ſecond Canon (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek Coppy tranſlated by <hi>Gentianus</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to eſtabliſh <hi>what theyr holy fore Fathers had delivered vnto them,</hi> confirmeth this, and the other Councel of Carthage. Go further downwards, and ſtill all Doctors and writers, in theyr dayly allegations of Scripture, cite theſe bookes as Scripture. The true Canon again is ſett forth by the Councel of Florence Anno 1438. To which Councel the very Grecians, Armenians, and Iacobites ſubſcribed: No man pertinaciouſly gainſaying this ſo well eſtabliſhed tradition vntill <hi>Luther.</hi> Now if the true diſcouery of Scripture be to goe by the votes of the beſt and the moſt eyes, who ſeeth not, but that even by this rule, wee ſhall have above halfe a ſcore bookes diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be Gods word, which your own ſharpe eyes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee to be ſo? eſpecially that ſecond book of Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees in which wee ſo clearly diſcouer Purgatory c. 12. v. 43. 44. 45. If any man objecteth, that, in the Councel of Carthage &amp;c. that one book of the Prophet <hi>Baruch</hi> is not ſet down by name (though never excluded:) he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this book of <hi>Baruch,</hi> is ioyned in our Bible with <hi>Ieremy,</hi> whoſe Secretary he was, and as his Secretary he ioyned his book as an Appendix to <hi>Ieremy:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnderſtood by theſe Fathers to be admitted to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62436:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with all <hi>Ieremy,</hi> excluding no part of him, as you exclude. I end then this Sixth reaſon thus. The beſt ſeeing eyes of antiquity have ſeen different bookes to be Gods word, from thoſe which you hould to be ſo: again, your own firſt bretheren in your Reformation have ſeen thoſe books not to be Canonicall, which you have ſeen to be ſo; therefore the true Scripture is not infallibly to be known by ſo evident a light as you ſpeak of, by which Contradictories can never be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If any man think he can eſcape the force of any of theſe arguments, by pretending the private aſſurance of the Spirit, making this dimme light appear clearly to him, which ſo many others (for want of the aſſiſtance of this ſpirit) come not to ſee: this man will runne vpon two mayne inconveniences. The Firſt is, that he moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly layeth claime for him ſelfe, and for all the litle flock of his bretheren, to have in private this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the ſpirit aſſiſting them, even as farre as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, to the hardeſt of all points: and yet, moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly denyeth any ſuch aſſiſtance to the vniverſall Church, repreſented in a generall Councel. He denyeth alſo the ſame ſpirit vnto the greateſt Doctors of the Church, confeſſed by all to have been the cheefe lights of the world for Sanctity and knowledg in Scriptures: For all theſe are found ſtanding directly oppoſite to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their Canon of Scripture, and not one of them can be ſhewed to agree with them in this prime ground of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any book for Gods word, vpon the light which God gave him by the Spirit. The ſecond inconvenience is, that, when he is queſtioned to give an account, how he is aſſured that he in particular hath this aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, ſufficeing to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an infallible aſſent; and how
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62436:42"/>
he is moſt aſſured that this is not an illuſion? He can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer, that he hath tried, as well as he (poor Soule) could, whether this Spirit were from God or no; and he found it (and that infallibly) to be from God. But S.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I ask you by what infallible meanes did you try it? If you ſay (as you muſt needs ſay) that you tryed it by the word of God: wee cannot but pitty your pittifull anſwer; for you forget that, before this triall was made, you could not have any aſſurance that the Scripture was Gods word; to the beleefe of which truth you cannot poſſibly come, vntill you have firſt an infallible aſſurance, that you in particular have Gods Spirit. For tell mee, by what other way you can come to this aſſurance? How can you then ſay, that you have tried your Spirit by that word, which, before this triall of your Spirit, you could not poſſibly know to be infallibly Gods word. You will all walk in a circle, as the wicked do, and as that wicked ſpirit who circles about to ſee whom he can devoure: vntill you come to ſtand ſtedfaſtly vpon the Rock of the Church.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is in vaine to know for certaine, that my Father did (to my great advantage) make a true authenticall will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which I conceive my ſelfe to have a true Copy: without I can authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically prove, the Copy that I have to bee indeed authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. So, it is to ſmall purpoſe, that God did, by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, write ſuch bookes as <hi>Geneſis, Exodus</hi> and the reſt of the old and new Teſtament, to our ineſtimable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; vnleſſe I can alſo, by vndenyable aſſurance, ſhew my ſelfe to have the true authenticall and vncorrupted Copyes of all theſe bookes; vncorrupted, I ſay, in all parts of them: for if it were not known to bee vncorrupted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, it might bee ſuſpected of falſity every where
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62436:43"/>
Now, that the Copyes, which wee have of Scripture, even in the Hebrew, or Greeke tongues, bee vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee are no where told plainely in Scripture. The laſt part of the Scripture which was written, was written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand and ſix hundred yeares agoe. No Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath been written, ſince that time, to telle vs, that ſince that time no corruption hath happened, or falſyfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the copyes written ſince that time: no Scripture then written did plainely aſſure us, that the Scriptures ſhould never bee corrupted by thoſe who printed, or writt them. Neither did the Apoſtles take care to haue the Copyes, written by them, to bee authentically ſigned, ſealed, and delivered into the hands of ſuch and ſuch, as might au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically declare their being true originals, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things exactly with the true originals; which is an evident ſigne, that God intended not the Scriptures for our Iudge, and only direction in all points: For all law-makers vſe this diligence, to ſecure their lawes from corruption. Behold then, here is now a ſixteenth point primely neceſſary to ſalvation, and yet no where ſett downe in Scripture: I ſay, primely neceſſary; for if it bee neceſſary to have faith, it is neceſſary to have the only Rule directing, and guiding to true faith, no where made crooked and directed falſe, as a falſe corrupted Copy would doe. Here then, you muſt flye to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; yea, and to the Tradition of the preſent Church alſo: for the Church of other ages could not aſſeure vs that the Scripture ſhould bee vncorrupted in our Age. Is it not as great a contradiction as can bee, to ſay, wee know by the tradition of the preſent Church that; that very Scripture is vncorrupted, which very Scripture bids vs not to beleeue the Tradition of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62436:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church: Which if I doe not beleeue, I cannot beleeue the Scripture to bee vncorrupt, and that infallibly if her Tradition (vpon which onely I beleeue this) bee fallible? The traditions then of the preſent Church bee as infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true as your faith; which I proue by this Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Your faith cannot bee more infallibly true, then it is true that the Copyes of the Scripture bee vncorrupt; for your faith is built vpon the word of God, as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you by theſe Copyes: juſt as wee ſay, our faith is built vpon the word of God, as propounded or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vs by the Church: but it is not infallibly true, that the Copyes wee haue now bee vncorrupted, becauſe that very Tradition of the preſent Church which telleth vs this, is held by you to be fallible and ſubject to lye; and which in a multitude of her other Traditions, hath lyed vnto vs, according to your doctrine. Here you ſee againe that you beleeve nothing at all with divine faith; For all you beleeve, you beleeve vpon the word of God, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to you by ſuch Copyes as you onely, by an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faith, know to bee the true deliverers of Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted word: This ground is fallible, being meerely humane; therefore the ground which ſupporteth all you beleeve, is humane, and not divine; Therefore all your faith is humane, and not divine: And this holdeth true in all and every point which you beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I will now further ſhew you, how you cannot know by Scripture onely, that the copyes of it bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, in thoſe very languages in which the Scripture was written: And yet this point is primely neceſſary to ſalvation, as I now proved; And indeed if the Originalls ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee known aſſeuredly to bee vncorruptedly copyed out, all the tranſlations of theſe Originals may alſo bee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62436:44"/>
falſe: Now the more they agree with corrupted Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, the more wee are ſure they are corrupted. But of Tranſlations I will ſpeake in the next ſection: Here I will ſpeake of the Copyes, which are ſayd to be Copied out of the true Originall Copyes, agreeing word for word with thoſe very Copyes, which <hi>S. Paul, S. Mathew, Moſes</hi> &amp;c. did write; Theſe Copyes wee know by no ſcripture to bee vncorrupt. Yea, if you will hold the Church to bee fallible; I will bring you ſeverall convincing proofs, that there can bee no certainty, that theſe Copyes agree with the true Copyes written by the true ſcripture writers. Theſe ſcripture-writers did write, either in ſuch Hebrew as was vſed in the Age in which they did write, (as did the writers of the old Teſtament:) or they did write in Greeke; as did moſt of the writers of the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Lett vs ſee firſt, how diſagreeing the Hebrew Copyes may bee, from the Originall Copye of the true writer thereof: Then wee will ſee the ſame of the Greeke Copyes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Firſt; diverſe of the very originals themſelves were written by ſuch men as wee know not at all, and ſo wee cannot know them certainely to have been true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but by Tradition; which, if it may bee falſe, it may alſo bee falſe, that they were true Prophets, haveing Gods true ſpirit, aſſuring them infallibly in all that they did write: And ſo, though wee did infallibly know, that wee had a moſt vncorrupted Copye of what they did write, yet wee ſhould not bee able to know that it were Gods infallible word; For how could wee know that he who writ this booke, was a true Prophet; no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as farre as any body knoweth) telling vs one word of that man, good or bad? For theſe bookes were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God knoweth whom. Wee haue nothing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62436:44"/>
opinions concerning the writers of diverſe of the moſt aſſured and protocanonicall bookes of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as of the bookes af <hi>Ioshua, Ruth, Iudges, Eſter,</hi> the bookes of <hi>Kings</hi> the bookes of Chronicles, or <hi>Paralypome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> So alſo, it is not certaine whether <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe did write his bookes of proverbs: or ſome that were about him did ſeverally, in ſcattered papers, one note what hee heard at one time; another what hee heard him ſay at another time: And then, in the dayes of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> ſome certaine men (God know's who they were) belonging to <hi>Ezechias;</hi> did make that collection of them which wee now have; as the moſt learned <hi>Lyranus</hi> holdeth, writing on that booke, and grounding himſelfe on theſe words, cap: 25. <hi>Theſe are alſo Proverbs of Solomon which the men of Ezechias Copyed out.</hi> Wherefore not vpon the authority of any ſcripture; but meerely vpon the authority of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee know thoſe true Originall Copyes to have been penned by true Prophets: though wee know not who they were.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But, that which I preſſe moſt is; that, though wee had all infallible knowledge that could bee, that ſuch Prophets and <hi>Moyſes</hi> had writt, with their owne hands, ſuch and ſuch bookes: Yet it is impoſſible (if the preſent Churches authority bee fallible) to know infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether the Copyes, wee have now in our dayes, agree in all places exactly with the Originall. Yea, wee are ſure they do not agree with it, which I prove thus: Noe bookes of Scripture were ſo ſolemnly, publickly, and moſt authentically delivered to bee kept, juſt as they were written, as the bookes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> witneſſe the Scripture, <hi>Exodus</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 4. and <hi>Deutr.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>And it came to paſſe when Moyſes had made an end of writing the words
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62436:45"/>
of the Law in a booke, vntill they were finished: that Moyſes commanded the Leuites, which bare the Arke of the Covenant of our Lord, ſaying take this booke of the Law, and put it in the ſide of the Arke of the Covenant of the Lord, that it may bee there for a witneſse &amp;c.</hi> But theſe very bookes, thus <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, vntill they were finished,</hi> have manifeſtly received the Addition of the laſt chapter of Deutronomy which was written after the death of <hi>Moyſes;</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth. So Gen. 26. the 31. verſe is cleerely added by ſome body, who lived in the times in which the Children of Iſraël had Kinges: which was long after the dayes of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> how then could he ſay, <hi>And theſe are the Kings which reigned in the Land of Edom, before there reigned any King over the Children of Iſraël?</hi> Who could ſett downe theſe Kings as haveing reigned vntill the dayes of the Kings of Iſraël, But ſome body who lived after their reigne? <hi>Bonfrerius,</hi> in his preface to the Pentateuck, addeth two other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, changed ſince <hi>Moyſes</hi> writt them. That the like chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have happened to the booke of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to the fourth of Kings and to <hi>Ieremy,</hi> is witneſſed by <hi>Torniellus Anno Mundi</hi> 1612. But let no man thinke, that I recount theſe changes as corruptions; for wee all believe thoſe additions to have been made to the true Copyes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and thoſe other writers by men ſpecially inſpired by God to make them: Yet wee, ſtanding onely to the humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of hiſtory, cannot tell by whom thoſe changes were made: no hiſtory telling vs, that the authors of theſe changes were Prophets, or Impoſters. Onely wee have the tradition of the preſent Church, aſſuring vs infallibly (which ſhee could not, if ſhee were fallible) that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wee now at preſent have, are infallibly Gods word: and conſequently, what changes ſo ever have been made
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62436:45"/>
in them, were made by ſufficient authority from God. You, who reject this authority of the Church, can have no aſſurance that many other changes were not made, as well as theſe: and ſuch changes as may bee moſt foule cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for any thing you know. Again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If wee ſpeake of ſuch changes as may bee both corruptions, and moſt pernicious corruptions, in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Bible: You (who reject the teſtimony of the Church as a fallible witneſſe,) cannot poſſibly make it appeare, that the Hebrew Copyes bee not groſſely corrupted ſince the times of the Apoſtles: For many and great chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might, after their times, be made by the Iewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins (men moſt perfidious and malicious,) when they did adde points to the Text, vnder pretence of preventing ſuch miſtakes, as might eaſyly happen to the leſſe skillfull, in reading the Hebrew text; which to that day had no points to expreſſe the vowels: For in the Originall it was written onely with Conſonants, and the vowels were left to bee added by the well inſtructed Reader; for whoſe helpe (in reading the Scriptures right,) the Iewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins did firſt beginne to adde certaine points, ſo to tell vs where an A, or an E, or any other vowell was to bee added according to the true manner of reading that place. Now onely God knowes whether theſe, ſo malicious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Iewes, taught vs to reade every vowell as it ſhould bee read in ſuch a place: and did not; by the add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what vowels they pleaſed change the ſence of the word, to ſignifye what they pleaſed. The putting of the vowels right or wrong depended, not onely vpon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredneſſe of theyr skill, which (for any thing wee know) might in ſome places bee deficient, and wee not knowing theſe places, are ſeure of no places: but alſo the putting
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62436:46"/>
of theſe vowels depended primely on their ſincere, and vpright honeſt dealing: which wee cannot, in true pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, much expect from ſuch ſworne enemyes to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, as thoſe Iewes were. Such men then as theſe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all and every one of the vowels, to every word of the Hebrew text, a good while after the Apoſtles time: what humane evidence have wee, ſufficing to a certaine aſſurance, of the adding the right vowell to every ſyllable of the whole Hebrew Bible? If wrong vowels bee added, the ſence will bee incredibly wronged: The vowell is the very ſoule of the ſyllable, either making, or marring the true ſound and ſignification, and altering it to moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſences; In ſo much that, not onely in every word, but even in every ſyllable, alteration may bee made of the true ſence. So in the latine word <hi>monere</hi> to admoniſh, if you change the vowels at your pleaſure (as thoſe Iewiſh Rabbins might often doe, for any thing wee know) you may reade <hi>moneri,</hi> to bee admoniſhed; <hi>manere,</hi> to ſtay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>manare,</hi> to flow from; <hi>minari,</hi> to threaten; <hi>munire,</hi> to fence; <hi>muniri,</hi> to bee well fenced; <hi>munera,</hi> guifts; <hi>minora,</hi> leſſe things: And thus the vowels change and alter the right word in ſeverall parts. The Hebrew la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage is moſt ſubject to this inconvenience of any other, becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts exceeding much of words of one ſyllable; in which the change of the vowell, maketh the ſence a perfect changeling. So in Engliſh, ſuppoſe the Scripture ſhould ſpeake againſt the abuſes in <hi>Balls:</hi> there comes a Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and hee will ſay, it is againſt the abuſes of Popiſh <hi>Bulls;</hi> there comes a Puritane, and he will ſay it is againſt the abuſe of <hi>Bells,</hi> vſeing them in ſuch manners as have no authority in Scripture; ſome vpſtart Sectary will ſay it is againſt <hi>Bills,</hi> and other armes, which Chriſtian milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62436:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth not allow of. See heere how the change of one vowell in one ſyllable onely, quite altereth the ſenſe. This change of one vowell, makes <hi>a fatt man,</hi> to bee <hi>a fitt man:</hi> and <hi>fatneſſe</hi> in all places, to bee <hi>fitneſſe</hi> in all places: It maketh that which is <hi>Better,</hi> to bee <hi>Bitter:</hi> It maketh <hi>a pott full of Butter</hi> to bee <hi>a pitt full of Batter.</hi> Though you magnify ſo much the preſent Hebrew Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye, as wee have it now pricked and pointed, to point vs out the true vowels; yet your owne Engliſh Bibles, in ſeverall places, teſtifye their corruption, by forſaking their tranſlation to follow ours: I will give you but one example; Wee, (and you with vs) reade, <hi>They have pierced my hands and my feete,</hi> Pſal. 22. v. 16. So cleare a Propheſye for our Saviours Crucifixion, is quite turned to another ſenſe in the preſent Hebrew Copyes, where theſe malicious Iewes make vs reade, <hi>As a Lyon my hands and feete.</hi> Thus you ſee how very little is the aſſurance, which thoſe, who know Hebrew, have, even of their very reading it right as it ſhould bee, acccording to the true meaning of the ſcripture-writer: Of <hi>David</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of whoſe true meaning, theſe falſe pointers have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed vs. Wee then now have no aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to know what vowels ſhould have been putt. And if any man now in theſe dayes, doth pretend to bee ſure that hee hath ſo much skill, as to tell, by the conſonants onely, what vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els ſhould for certaine bee putt, according to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or of any other writer; I would onely deſire this cunning man, to giue mee a tryall of his skill, by telling mee what vowell I meane to have putt to theſe three Conſonants, <hi>Bll:</hi> whether I meane to ſignifye <hi>a Ball,</hi> a <hi>Bell,</hi> a <hi>Bill,</hi> or a <hi>Bull.</hi> You will ſooner tell mee whether the pinnes I hold now in my left hand bee even
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62436:47"/>
or odde? Here you will bee ſure to hitt right at twice; for ſurely they bee one of the two: But you may gueſſe twice two times, before you aſſuredly Propheſye, whether I meane by thoſe three conſonants to ſignifye <hi>a Bal, a Bell, a Bill, or a Bull.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. I come now to the new Teſtament, which almoſt all of it (except <hi>S. Matthewes</hi> Goſpell) was by the Apoſtles themſelves written in Greeke. The chiefe points of our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62436:48"/>
our faith depend vpon the new Teſtament. If the Copyes in this language agree not exactly, and in all places, (for falſity in one place proveth poſſibility of falſity in other places) with the firſt Copyes written by the Apoſtles; our Iudge (for whoſe ſole authority you plead) will bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of corruption, and therefore no infallible Iudge. Your greate Doctor <hi>Beza</hi> vpon Acts, 7.16. doth muſter vp a whole catalogue of corruptions in the Greeke Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes. The ſame <hi>Beza</hi> iudgeth <hi>Eraſmus</hi> the beſt of all latter tranſlators: and yet <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> ſpeaking of the Sixt of <hi>S.

Luke</hi> cap. 22. v. 20. reade thus. <hi>This cup is the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in my blood, which</hi> (cup) <hi>is shed for you.</hi> So that the <hi>Cup,</hi> that is the thing contained in the <hi>cup,</hi> was that very thing which was ſhed for vs; But not wine, but Chriſts true blood, was ſhed for vs: Therefore not wine, but Chriſts true blood, was the thing contained in the <hi>cup.</hi> It is a memorable thing which is lately related by <hi>Mr. Creſſy Exomol: Ca.</hi> 8. <hi>Nu.</hi> 3. in theſe words; <q>In my hearing, Biſhop <hi>Vsher</hi> profeſſed, that whereas hee had of many yeares before a deſire to publiſh the new Teſtament in Greeke, with various lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and annotations; and for that purpoſe had vſed great diligence, and ſpent much money to furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with manuſcripts: Yet in concluſion hee was forced to deſiſt vtterly, leaſt, if hee ſhould ingenuouſly have noted all the ſeverall differences of reading which himſelfe had collected: the incredible multitude of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoſt in every verſe, ſhould rather have made men A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall, then ſatisfy them in the true reading of any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62436:48"/>
particular paſſage. An evident ſigne that Governours of the Church did not rely onely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what was in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> So hee. And though hee hath now twice printed this, and though others have alſo divulged the ſame in print; Yet Biſhop <hi>Vsher,</hi> ſeeing this done before his eyes, doth not diſclaime fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it; Therefore I cannot but believe the ſtory to bee true: And if it bee true, how wonderfully corrupted is your only Iudge. Now if <hi>B. Vsher</hi> alone, in this remote corner of the world, beeing a private man, could procure ſo many old Copyes in writing; what might have been done by ſome greate Prince, vſeing all induſtry to gett (by meanes of other greate Princes, and all other diligences,) all the old Copyes they could? For as the multitude of Copyes, procured by Biſhop <hi>Vsher,</hi> did increaſe the variety of different readings; ſo a farre great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er multitude of Copyes, would, in all probability, have yet much more increaſed this variety &amp; difference. And the ſame variety, for the ſame cauſe, might yet have been found to bee farre greater, if five or ſixe greate Princes, liveing in five or ſix Kingdomes (at the greateſt diſtance from one another,) ſhould have all conſpired to gather together all the ancienteſt Copyes that were any where to bee had. Wherefore, if in thoſe onely copyes procured by Biſhop <hi>Vsher,</hi> the multitude of ſeverall readings <hi>were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible almoſt in every verſe:</hi> how much more <hi>incredible</hi> would the multitude of ſeverall readings bee, if the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I ſpoke of, ſhould bee vſed to procure a greater multitude of written Copyes? I aske now, when, in theſe later dayes printing was invented, how thoſe, who cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Greeke Tranſlation (which wee have) to bee printed: how (I ſay) could they know for certaine, that, that one reading (which they thought good to follow
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62436:49"/>
in their printed Copyes) was the true reading? Or how could any man tell which written Copye of B. <hi>Vshers</hi> was the true written Copye? I pray lett vs ſo much as know our Iudge, before wee bee obliged to accept of him in all matters. Yea, you make vs know hee is corrupted in many matters: and others may make vs know that he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in many more. And ſure I am, that corrupted Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are not competent Iudges. Crooked Rules are not good directors. The Rule that is given to vs all by God, to direct vs all, muſt bee a rule eaſily applyable by all: For this reaſon, you ſay all muſt reade the Scriptures, and your meaning is (and muſt bee) that they muſt reade the true Scriptures; that is, ſome true copye of the true bookes of Scripture: by what meanes ſhall they bee aſſured, that they read the true Copye, there beeing ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible difference between Copyes which are ſett forth for true? Not one, among an hundred thouſand, can have this aſſurance; either want of meanes to gett the reading of theſe manuſcripts, or for want of skill to reade them, and vnderſtand them ſo, as to bee able to informe himſelfe of their perfect agreeing in points neceſſary: eſpecially ſeeing that you ſo litle agree in teaching vs, which points be neceſſary and fundamentall, that you could never yet bee able to give vs the number of them; much leſſe to tell vs which they were, or in what bookes, or Chapters of the Bible, they were to bee found. Where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore hee, who will vpon his owne knowledge, and not vpon ſome other mans credit, (farre inferiour to a generall Councell,) informe himſelfe of the truth of his Copye (ſufficiently to have a full aſſurance that it is the true vndoubted Copye of the true vndoubted Word of God:) hee (I ſay) who will ſo much as hope to doe this, is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62436:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not one among an hundred thouſand. How then can this be that Rule given by God, to bee applyed by every man, to Iudge by it for himſelfe: by which one among one hundred thouſand cannot bee able to iudge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whether this vndoubtedly bee that Rule given him by God. Excellently Seneca, <hi>Omnia delibera cum ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, ſed priùs delibera de amico. All conſultations with thy ſure friend make: But firſt conſult Whom for this friend to take.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou conſulteſt the whole buſyneſſe of thyne eternity With this Copye, firſt conſult how ſure thou art of the ſureneſſe of this thy Copye. If every man (as proteſtants Will have it) bee to bee iudge for himſelfe, in points which ſo neerely concerne himſelfe, then doubtleſſe, in the very firſt place, hee is to bee iudge for himſelfe of this point aboue all points, which concernes him as much as that vpon which all other points of higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernement doe wholly depend.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, how, not one man among one hundred thouſand eſcapeth being gulled by you, Whileſt you all make him beleeve, that if hee will follow you, hee ſhall ſee with his owne eyes, what hee doth, and hee ſhall iudge for himſelfe: and not take his religion vpon truſt, as you make them beleeve wee doe, becauſe wee truſt generall Councels. O deareſt Brethren in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for his and for your owne ſakes, ſett your eyes at leaſt halfe ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and you ſhal preſently ſee, whether wee, or you bee thoſe who take vp our fayth on truſt. Doe wee doe this, becauſe wee beleeue and truſt general Councels? Theſe Councels, Euen in humane knowledge and ſincerity of iudgement, farre excell any private man, truſted by you in this capital point: and, beſides humane knowledge, they have the infallible aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62436:50"/>
to them; at leaſt as much, if not more then to thoſe men, whom you truſt. Or rather do not you take your fayth on truſt? for who of you is able to iudge for himſelfe, Which is the true vndoubted Copie of the true Word of God, by which onely you muſt rule your fayth in all points? And who therefore is there among you, who ſeeing himſelfe wholly vnable to iudge for himſelfe in this point, (on which all others wholly depend) is not forced to rely vpon incomparable Weaker authority, then is the authority of a Generall Councell, to which the prime Prelates of this World are called, bringing with them the ableſt Divines they can gett, Each one in the Province, from which hee cometh: And all of the Councel deliuering not ſo much theyr opinion (equall at leaſt to yours) but deliuering what hath bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiued Vniverſally from their Anceſtors, without note of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereas you, when all comes to all, muſt in this very point of points, rely wholly on the authority of thoſe few learned men, who have thought good to ſett forth this Copye, which you take vpon their word to agree faythfully in all places With the true vndoubted Originall. And this alſo muſt bee done by you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and by you M<hi rend="sub">r</hi>. <hi>Doctor,</hi> Without you bee Perhaps a man more learned, then that one, who cannot bee picked out among an hundred thouſand. Now if this be the caſe of men though ſo very learned; What more cleer then that the leſſe learned (which make vp the multitude of ſoules redeemed by <hi>Chriſt</hi>) cannot poſſibly iudge for themſelves in this point of points; but muſt truſt others to iudge for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and rely wholly vpon their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What thinke you now? is this as ſafe as relying on the Church Vniverſall, repreſented in a Generall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62436:50"/>
Councell? Now if this Councell may bee more Prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relyed vpon in this point of high concernment; Why may it not bee relyed vpon, and iudge for vs, in points of leſſe concernment? Shall I wiſely truſt a man with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, and bee vnwiſe, if I truſt him with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds? ſhall it bee moſt prudently done, to lett Generall Councels iudge for mee, which Bookes I am to hold for the Copyes of Gods Word, and ſhall it bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to lett a Generall Councell iudge for mee, whether I am to pray to Saints, or no? to pray for the dead, or no? to hold <hi>Chriſt</hi> moſt really preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or no? What Scripture, or any thing like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have you, to tell mee that the Church, repreſented in a Councell, ſhall not deceiue mee in this point (moſt important of all points:) but that it may deceiue mee in other things, in which it is more Eaſye to Iudge right? The Church is a Iudge, (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) to which the multitude of people may have free acceſſe; and heare plainely, clearely, and moſt vndoubtedly, what is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for true, by the ſentence of this moſt grave Iudge: And ſuch a iudge it beſeemed the Divine Providence to give to the people, if hee ſeriouſly deſired to bring them, by belief of the onely true fayth, to ſalvation. Whereas it is not poſſible, for one among one hundred thouſand, to heare plainely, clearely, and moſt vndoubtedly, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence delivered by any Booke of Scripture, concerning the true Copye of the true Scripture; though all my fayth muſt depend vpon this, as you ſay: Neither can you finde any other way to make mee ſecure of this choice of a true Copye, comparable to the authority of a generall Councell.</p>

your inward iudgement to the definitions of Councels: A Doctrine, making all your labour of very little or no vſe at all, to your Proteſtant Brethren: For ſome ſeven or eight yeares hence, when your Bible ſhall bee quite end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (for vntill the quite finiſhing of it, wee cannot have the benefitt of it as a Iudge,) then your owne Brethren muſt not truſt your iudgement, iudgeing for them in the choice of the true Copye, picked now out of one of your old Copyes, now out of another; now truſting to this old Copye moſt in this verſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by and by not truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it moſt in the next, or almoſt the next verſe. <hi>The due vſe of reaſon</hi> (ſay they) permits vs not to ſtand blindely to the publike iudgement, even of whole generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, when they define matters of leſſe moment, then is the taking vpon your word, our Iudge in all the points neceſſary to bee beleeved or practiſed. For though in the ſecond Councell of Nice Anno 787. no fewer then three hundred and fifty Fathers, did allow of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Reliques and holy Images of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Saints Act, 3: Yet wee have the private iudgement of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Iudge for our ſelves, becauſe wee are to anſwere for our ſelves; and wee (duely vſeing our reaſon) Iudge Worſhip of Images to bee either Idolatry or ſuperſtition. Now, if you allow vs, by your own Doctrine, not to truſt a whole general Councell of three hundred and fifty ancient Fathers; you have not <hi>the due vſe of reaſon</hi> your ſelves, if you thinke wee may lawfully blinde our ſelves ſo farre as to lett you Iudge for vs in a farre more important point; that is, in the takeing the onely Rule of our whole fayth vpon your iudgement. I muſt, in this point, have your leave not to accept of any one of your Copyes, as ſufficiently true, to bee my Rule in my whole

But I goe on, and confeſſe that I ſee it is evident enough, that you doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſay, that you give mee the beſt Copyes that can bee gott; and that, which is more, I ſee it is evident that you doe indeed ſay all your Copyes agree in things, which are neceſſary to ſalvation: But I doe not, nor cannot ſet (though one among one hundred thouſand bee not ſo learned as I) that all you ſay to mee is evidently true, vntill I have conferred all the Copyes as well as you; and vntill I bee as fully certifyed of the antiquity, and choice exactneſſe of all your Copyes, as well as you: and this is impoſſible for mee, vntill I can vnderſtand all thoſe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages as well as you; and pervſe all the authenticall teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonyes, which you have of this antiquity, and perfect exactneſſe of your Copyes. Beſides all this, how can I truſt you to Iudge in all and every point, whether the agreement of all the Copyes bee exact in all and every point fundamentall and neceſſary to ſalvation: for I know, wee our ſelves cannot agree which bee all the points fundamentall and neceſſary; and my iudgement may in this vaſtly differ from yours, as much and as lawfully as it differs from the Councell I now ſpoke of. Thus much your owne Brethren muſt bee allowed to ſay.</p>

was quite loſt (for as much as concerneth the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar vſe) in the Captivity of Babilon, ſome ſix hundred yeares before Chriſt. How hard then muſt it bee now to know the full force, which common vſe gave theſe words two or three and twenty hundred yeares agoe? What skill can bee knowne to bee heere ſecure? beſides the difficulty of the points of which I have ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the wilfull miſtakes, which this meſſenger may committ, either fully on ſett purpoſe, to make all goe the way which hee conceiveth to bee beſt, vpon his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate affection to it, or diſaffection to the contrary: or rather, not ſo much with ſo plaine downe right wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as with an overſwaying preiudice, which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed his iudgement, that the way which hee, as from thy guide, biddeth the to goe, is the onely true way: not that hee is fully ſure that thy guide did clearely ſay ſo; but thy meſſenger thought beſt to putt downe clearely this way for thy true way, becauſe his owne preiudice of its beeing ſo, and his greate deſire that it ſhould bee held by all to bee ſo, have prevailed with him to deliver it clearely to bee ſo. Moreover this thy Tranſlator or meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger had not immediate acceſſe to Gods word, in that very hand writing in which it was written by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture writer: from ſuch but what he knoweth, he knoweth Copyes as were written by men of vnknown fidelity, who perhaps often were ſuch hireling pen-men as had more care to write much, that they might gain much; then to write with all perfect exactnes, and to take due paines and care in conferring theyr tranſcribed Copyes with the Copyes they tranſcribed. And thoſe very Copyes alſo were perhaps writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out with the like careleſnes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this careleſnes; ignorance might likewiſe cauſe
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62436:55"/>
many a miſtake in ſo long a worke, becauſe all neither knew the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages perfectly which they tranſcribed, nor did not perhaps know ſo cunningly thoſe abbreviations which thoſe pennne men then vſed even almoſt at every word; in which alſo one writer often differs from an other: Hence in a long work numberles miſtakes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which ſoon grow to a farre greater number, whileſt ſo many ſubſequent tranſcribers out of former Miſtakers come to adde theyr new miſtakes to thoſe former. And to do it in a hand fitt to cauſe theyr miſtakes to be yet more multiplyed, when more Copyes (ſubiect ſtill to the like inconvenience) come to be tranſcribed out of them ſucceſſiuely for many ages. Now thy meſſenger or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator, in this vaſt variety of Copyes, (of which wee ſpoke more in the laſt Chapter) if hee findeth but one or two Copyes, which more favour that way which hee would have all goe, or thinketh in his private iudgement to bee true; hee makes choiſe to interpret this miſtaken Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye for Gods owne word, and ſets it downe as advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly as he can, to further his opinion and his deſire to bring ſuch a way into greateſt requeſt. From ſuch men as theſe, you are immediately to take that direction for your onely Rule and guide: And yet, though you ſee with your eyes, your onely direction to come ſo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to you; and, that you moſt manifeſtly neither doe here Iudge for your ſelves, nor can poſſibly Iudge for your ſelves in this Capitall point (comprehending all the points you are to beleeve:) yet you are taught by all your prime Doctors, that, as you are to anſwere to God for your ſelves in all you beleeve; ſo you muſt, by your ſelves alſo, Iudge for your ſelves in all you beleeve. Yet (O prepoſterous! O Monſtrouſly prepoſterous!) you, in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62436:56"/>
this cheefeſt point of all, muſt rely vpon the authority of a few Engliſh Tranſlators; who exact of you to rely on them with more confidence, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will permitt you to rely vpon the authority of a whole generall Councell, ſeconded by the authority of the graveſt Fathers which the church of God hath had: And you, who are taught to follow and believe nothing but ſcripture, are now taught, without any one text of ſcripture to take the Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of men for your onely guides, in all and every point of your fayth; and ſuch Tranſlations alſo as wee iuſt now deſcribed, and ſhall here more fully deſcribe. In the meane time note, that here I have one more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary point, not clearely ſett downe in ſcripture, to adde to the former ſixteen. If any deny this point to bee neceſſary to ſalvation, let him anſwer this Argument: that is neceſſary to ſalvation, without which I cannot come to bee aſſuredly guided to true fayth; But I (who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not both Greeke and Hebrew) can not, without a truely Tranſlated Bible, come to bee aſſuredly guided to true fayth; the true Bible beeing (as you teach mee) the onely rule guiding and directing to true fayth: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary for mee, to vſe a truely Tranſlated Bible: But no ſcripture doth direct mee in the choice of a truely tranſlated Bible; Therefore ſcripture doth not direct mee in all points neceſſary for mee to ſalvation.</p>

Here againe I inferre, that all that vaſt number of people, who, knowing not perfectly both Greeke and Hebrew, are forced not to Iudge for themſelves which is the true word of God, muſt of neceſſity rely vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vncertaintyes in this very point, vpon which all their whole fayth doth rely.

                     <hi>That the Book of Common Prayer conteyneth nothing contrary to the word of God.</hi> By reaſon of the vrging this ſubſcription, many, marking well that in theyr Common Prayer theyr Epiſtles, Goſpells, Pſalmes &amp;c. were conteyned, all which were taken out of theyr Bible: and knowing by theyr learning that theyr Bible, even then, was full of groſſe corruptions, contrary to the word; began now openly to diſcover theſe errors. Hence divers Miniſters <hi>in a Treatiſe to her excellent Majeſty ſpoke thus; Our Tranſlation of the Pſalmes, comprized in our Book of Common Prayer, doth in Addition, Subtraction, and Alteration, differ from the truth of the Hebrew in two hundred places at leaſt.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Burges</hi> in his Apology <hi>S.</hi> 6. writeth thus; <hi>How shall I approve vnder my hand a Tranſlation which hath many omisſions, many Additions, which ſometimes obſcureth, ſometimes peruerteth the ſenſe, beeing ſometimes ſenſeles: ſometimes contrary.</hi> And <hi>Carlict</hi> ſayth in his book of <hi>Chriſts</hi> deſcent to Hell.

Bishops and Diuines, to ſee what they could ſay againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gouuernement of the English Church. In this Conference D.</hi> Reynolds <hi>motioned that there might be a new Tranſlation of the Bible; becauſe the preſent Tranſlation were Corrupt, and not anſwerable to the truth of the Original; where of he alledged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers examples, particularly that in the hundred and fifth Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. V.</hi> 28 <hi>where it is ſayd They were not obedient; in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is, They were not diſobedient. To this it was agreed that a new Tranſlation should be made.</hi> Thus farre Sir <hi>Richard</hi> word for word. By all which it is euident that your Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, Doctors, Deuines &amp;c. in Queen Elizabeths dayes, euen to her laſt day, did ſubſcribe, and by Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were ordered to ſubſcribe, that falſifyed word of God to be the true word of God; though it were flatly contrary (as in the place now cited) to the true word. How knoweſt thou that the Deuines now, though they miſſe not alwaye in the ſame places perhaps, yet perhaps they may miſſe in Others of as great conſequence? The Scripture was held then as confidently to be the only Rule of faith, and cited as faſt, and as thick, for Gods word then, as it is now; And yet now your very Bible coming forth on that occaſion, doth as good as tell you; the former Bible was not Gods true word. Diuers years after the reſolution made of ſetting forth this new Bible, there ſtill remayned ſuch open complains of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word of God, that <hi>Mr. Broughton</hi> (a man as skilfull in Hebrew and Greek as any was in England) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his skill did giue this Cenſure in <hi>his Aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſement of Corruptions to the Bishops;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That theyr pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranſlation of Scriptures into English is ſuch as it peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Text of the ould Teſtament in eight hundred forty eight places; and that it cauſeth millions of millions to reiect the new
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62436:59"/>
Teſtament, and to runne to eternall flames.</hi> In what caſe then hath this your doctrine putt you, which hath taken you off from following the iudgement, of the Church in a generall Councel, to make you Iudge for your own ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: when your learnedeſt Deuines (who made ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Tranſlations) did ſo ill Iudge for them and others? Vpon thy ſelfe then thou canſt not ſafely rely in this poinct; neither canſt thou rely vpon thy Tranſlators, who haue vſed thee thus: Find mee then, for Gods ſake, find mee, if thou canſt, any where any, but halfe ſo ſure, a ground as is that of the Church, which is the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Ground of Truth.</hi> Thou doeſt not only venture the beeing deceiued in this great point of the vprightnes of thy only Rule, and Iudge; but it is manifeſt that thou art deceiued: for, thy Rule (which is thy preſent Engliſh tranſlated Bible) ſtill ſtandeth accuſed of many and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Corruptions. Not to trouble thee much, I will tell thee only of one or two; Thy Tranſlator had a mind to make thee beleeue that faith only could ſaue thee; a damnable Doctrine, vnknown to the greateſt Doctors of the Church, which could not be, were it the only thing which did iuſtify and ſaue vs, as thy Tranſlator would perſwade thee, when tranſlating what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayd to the blinde man, whom he cured <hi>Luke</hi> 18.43. he makes <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſay, <hi>thy faith ſaued thee,</hi> in place of ſaying, <hi>thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> Again, though <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by way of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, did propoſe in a generall manner the embracing of a chaſte ſingle life <hi>Matt:</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 12. ſaying; <hi>He that is able to receiue it, let him receiue it:</hi> Thy Tranſlator had a mind to make thee beleeue not only that euery one did not receiue this doctrine, but he makes <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe tell vs, <hi>All men cannot, receiue this ſaying.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayd only, <hi>All men do not receiue this ſaying,</hi> as is euident out of the Greek. Is this faire dealing? is it all one to ſay, <hi>All men doe not lead ſingle liues;</hi> and to ſay, <hi>All men cannot lead ſingle liues,</hi> though they vſe faſting, praying &amp;c. This is as wilfull an errour, as it would be in one who heard mee ſay (and alſo ſet it down in writing to preuent miſtake) <hi>All men are not honeſt;</hi> ſhould report that I ſayd, <hi>All men cannot be honeſt.</hi> When I ſee a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator not to make any conſcience of ſo willfully falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Gods own word, in fauor of his own opinion; haue not I iuſt reaſon to ſay, I cannot be ſure of my faith in all points, if I (vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this mans authority) take his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation as the only Rule of my faith in all points? What more clear?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Here I muſt needs examin the doctrine which thoſe great maiſters of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t languages, who now ſet forth that mighty work of the Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bible, in ſo many learned ancient languages, who in the introduction to this theyr Bible (of which I ſpoke in the laſt <hi>Sectin.</hi> 8) ſpoke thus; <hi>It is not neceſſary for the producing faith in the people, that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hould be a tranſlation wholy infallible; ſeeing that de facto it is evident, that among thoſe numberles Tranſlations which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant this day in Europe, there is none of all them which is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and infallible authority: For faith doth rely on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or veracity of God, which allwayes is certaine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, although all the meanes be not infallible; For tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have only ſo farre authority as farre as they agree with the firſt own-hand written Originall: But they are ſufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith when they conteyne</hi> (who knowes when that is?) <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation, without any error againſt faith or good manners.</hi> So they. Lett vs examin, what they ſay, by parts as it lyeth in order, and that in order to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe only: and not in order to examin how true
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62436:60"/>
all they ſay is. If true faith can be had now without any infallible Tranſlation, then the Bible is not our only guide to true faith, and our only Iudge in points controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in faith: for this judge muſt be infallible, as all your Doctors teach. If you anſwer the Iudge is not the tranſlated Copy, but the Originall in Greek, and Hebrew. I ask you, what ſhall almoſt all the world do to hear this infallible Iudge ſpeak? For almoſt all are deafe to all that is ſpoken in Greek and Hebrew. If there be not one infallible Tranſlation in Europe at this day; how at this day are all deluded, who are taught on the one ſide to judge for them ſelves, and on the other ſide are tould that they cannot handle the Ruler by which they ſhould Rule theyr judgement in all points: but they muſt be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fallible Lesbian Rule of lead, bent as it pleaſed the Tranſlator? Again, how is it poſſible God ſhould bidd the people to ſearch the truth in the Bible, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the only place to find it in; but alſo as the only place for them to find it in: For God knew all people could not ſearch truth in any Bibles, but ſuch as are tranſlated into a language they vnderſtand; God knew all theſe Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were lyars, if indeed they be ſo as you ſay; Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God bidde any man ſeek for the truth, only at a lyars mouth? Yea, would God, who loveth Soules ſo well, give them no better meanes to know the truth wholy neceſſary to Salvation? True it is, faith doth rely vpon the truth of God, who ſaid ſuch a thing to be ſo and ſo: but if my Tranſlator tell mee; that God ſaid ſuch a thing was ſo and ſo; and yet God ſayd no ſuch thing, but an other thing very differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in place of which my Tranſlator ignorantly or wilfully obtrudes this thing: here manifeſtly I am left leaning, with all my force, vpon a Lye. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62436:61"/>
you tell vs that Tranſlation (the only Rule wee can handle) <hi>have only ſo farre divine authority as farre as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the firſt own-hand-written Originals;</hi> This is ſmall comfort to vs, to whom it is impoſſible to know how farre this is. Yea you yourſelves know not which be the true own-hand-written-originals, which you confeſſe to have periſhed, though you ſay that they be faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by your laborious gathering a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferring together more exquiſite Copies then hitherto have been publiſhed: which how true it is, I know not. And then ſecondly, without wee alſo know the languages, which you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs very fayth ully, (as wee perhaps ſuppoſe,) it is impoſſible for vs to know how farre our Tranſlations agree with the Originals: therefore it is impoſſible for vs to know, how farre wee may truſt to theyr authority as divine, or ſuſpect it as human. And ſo by clear conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is impoſſible for vs to know when and where wee may give a moſt full vndoubted aſſent to what wee find tranſlated in our Bibles. Is this the comfort you leave vs at laſt, when vpon our leaving to rely vpon the Rock of the Church, you promiſed to make vs men knowing what wee do in all points: and now, wee are ſure wee know not what wee doe in any? For wee know not what our only Rule bids vs to hould vpon Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or what that man bids vs vpon his authority only to hould, when offering vs his owne Tranſlation, he bids vs take it for a divine Rule; which if he giveth not, wee are gulled even in that point which neereſt concerns our ſalvation. Indeed you conclude with a ſmall, crumme of comfort, when you tell vs; <hi>Tranſlations are ſufficient meanes to divine faith, when they contain all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without any errour againſt Faith or good manners.</hi> But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62436:61"/>
I pray reflect, how wholy impoſſible it is for vs to tell when they do this, without knowing firſt for certain al the points neceſſary to Salvation: about which you your ſelves are not yet agreed; neither can you give vs vp a liſt or catalogue of them. Nay, I may affirme, that no ſuch liſt or catalogue can be given, (though even here it be ſo apparently neceſſary) that thence wee might ſee whether there be any ſuch error in our Engliſh Bibles, in thoſe matters: Yea, all of you tell vs, that there is no way to know what is neceſſary to ſaluation, but by the true Bible; and yet wee (poore ſoules) cannot poſſibly come to know, which is the true Bible conteyning all poincts neceſſary to ſaluation, without any error in fayth or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; vntill wee know firſt that a true Bible hath tould vs ſo: And again, wee cannot know that Bible to be ſo true, which tould vs ſo; vntill wee know that, that very Bible conteyned all poincts neceſſary to ſaluation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any errour in faith or manners. This is not only to blind vs (as you ſay the Papiſts do, when they make vs follow the Church:) but it is to vſe vs as the Philiſtians vſed <hi>Sampſon;</hi> firſt to putt out our eyes, and then to make vs runne round in a mill, as blinded horſes do in horſe mills: For no circle is rounder, and goeth more about and about again in the ſame footſtepps, then the circle wee are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE alſo I muſt needs propoſe a difficulty, which, in the principles of your Religion, I conceiue to be vnanſwerable. You do no leſſe beleeue all things written in <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Goſpel, then you beleeue all things written in any other book of the Scripture: But euen your Doctors of the higheſt forme, haue no other authority for all things in <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Goſpel, but the Authority of a Tranſlation made by one, whome none of vs all know; and ſo wee can neither aſſure our ſelues of his fidelity, nor of his skill, nor of his care to vſe a true Copy, nor I of his induſtry in the vſe there of &amp;c. Now you tell vs (and it is true) that Tranſlations (preſcinding from any decree of the Church approuing of them) haue only ſo farre authority, as farre as they agree with the true Originall; But it is impoſſible for you (great Doctors) to know, how farre the tranſlated Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62436:62"/>
of <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpell agree with the Originall; becauſe, for theſe many ages, there hath not been known extant in the whole world, any one Copie of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-hand-writing of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> who did write in that kind of Hebrew which the Iewes ſpoke in his dayes, as all and euery one of the ancient Fathers (who haue writt of this matter, and whoſe workes wee haue) do teſtify, and <hi>S. Ierom libro de Schriptorib. Eccleſiaſticis</hi> affirmeth himſelfe to haue ſeen, and to haue alſo written out that Hebrew Copy. But for theſe many ages noe one Hebrew Copy hath appeared in the world which, with any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient probability, could be ſhewed to be a true Copy: whence it is euident, that none of you all can tell, how farre the Tranſlations wee haue of that Hebrew Copy, do agree with the Hebrew Copy; therefore, not one of you all can tell, how farre theſe Tranſlations, which wee haue now, be of diuine Authority, and how farre now wee may admitt them as Gods vndoubted word; there beeing no reaſon known to vs, why wee ſhould admitt them more in one place (vpon <hi>S. Matthews</hi> authority) then in an other: and there beeing no reaſon why wee ſhould admitt of the whole Tranſlation, made by I know not whom, rather then of other Tranſlations, whom wee know, to haue been made with all the beſt induſtries which human ability can afford: whence I can neither admitt the whole Tranſlation as diuine, nor any part of it, rather then the part I admitt not; I not knowing any one part to agree more with the true Originall, then the other. All the whole Ghoſpel I cannot receiue as diuine, for no Tranſlation at all, (much leſſe the tranſlations of a man vnknown) is to bee admitted as diuine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, there beeing no one ſuch in all Europe as you ſay.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62436:63"/>
Hence I demonſtrate, that you beleeue not <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpel with diuine Faith: For you cannot ſay, that you giue credit to any one thing in it for the authority of the writer of it, becauſe you know not any one thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from God by the writer vnto you, but vpon the authority of the Tranſlation, which is no further diuine then agreing with the true Copy; which agreement you neither know to be in this one point, or any other you can name. How can I know, how the Tranſlation agreeth with the Originall: if I know not what the Originall ſaith?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, to beleeue <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpel, is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, as to beleeue <hi>S. Lukes</hi> or <hi>S. Iohns;</hi> but no infallible Scripture (Tranſlations not beeing infallible) doth tell you that <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpel is the vndoubted word of God; How will you then proue this by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt the Marcioniſts the Cerdoniſts, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans, who deny this Ghoſpel to be Gods word? All points neceſſary to ſaluation, you ſay, are plainly ſett down in Scripture: Shew me this point plainly ſett down. Here then I haue one neceſſary poinct more, not plainly ſet down in Scripture which maketh the former ſeuen-teene poincts to be eighteene. Neither can you ſay, that, by the very reading this Tranſlation, you can diſcouer a light ſhewing it, as clearly as the Sunne, to be Gods word: For, though I can ſee no reaſon, why ſuch light might not be diſcouered, as well in true Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as in true Originals; yet becauſe you of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who only haue eyes to ſee this light, do profeſſe (as wee haue lately ſeen your greateſt Scripture-Doctors to profeſſe) that there is not one infallible Tranſlation in Europe; and becauſe wee ſee, euen ſuch Doctors as they are, not ſo much as to hope to diſcouer, by ſuch a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62436:63"/>
light, true Tranſlations from falſe ones; but to beſtow great paines in conferring the ſeuerall Copyes, of theyr ſeuerall tranſlations, with the beſt copyes of the originals which they can find; and by the agreeing, or not agreeing with theſe beſt copyes, to approue or reproue theſe Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; wee are by this certifyed, that they truſt nothing to this clear light, which if it were a reallity, and not a reall phanſy, were the beſt guide of all, and would ſaue them infinite paines: Yea, whatſoeuer (to auoid our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) they boaſt of this light; yet euen in the approuing or reprouing the Copyes of the Original it ſelfe, they truſt nothing to it. If I thought, they did truſt to ſuch an vngrounded Imagination, neither I, nor any one of my opinion (nor of thine neither, as I think) would euer buy one Copye of theyr Tranſlations.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now; if you cannot diſcouer any ſuch light aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of the truth of all things in <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpel, I am ſure you cannot do ſo in <hi>S. Iohns</hi> or <hi>S. Lukes,</hi> or any other: And your own Conſciences cannot but tell you, that the light diſcouering its ſelfe in <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> is as great as in any other book of Scripture; But this light is now clearely ſhewed to be vnſufficient to proue <hi>S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Ghoſpel to be Diuine, it beeing only a Tranſlation, which your beſt Doctors confeſſe to be fallible: neither is there any meanes to know one part of it to be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible then an other, vpon the authority of the writer there-of; becauſe wee know not which part agreeth with the true Copie of the writer. You ſay you fix your faith vpon what is Tranſlated, and not vpon the Tranſlation: But I ſay, if you fix your faith vpon what is tranſlated by a falſe Tranſlatour, you may ſoone fix your faith vpon a ly; at leaſt you cannot tell when you do ſo, and when
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62436:64"/>
you do not; For you know not whether the thing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered be agreeable to Gods word, or only to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters fancy; eſpecially when you know not of what credit the Interpreter is. Do you know it becauſe your phanſy alſo tells you this is Gods word? then thus wee may haue a double phantaſticall aſſurance, and nothing elſe; one from the vnknowne interpreters phanſy, an other from thy own. I thought your fayth had relied on Gods written word. What written word is that which can neither be ſhewed aſſuredly written in any Originall, nor in any Copye, nor in any Tranſlation of the Original Copye? If you fly at laſt to that miſerable ſhift, as to ſay, that the Illumination of the Spirit can tell you Gods word, without the mediation of any certain vndoubted meanes, conueighing it vnto you: then you muſt needs be Prophets all, and euery one of you. Who euer heard of ſuch a Church in this world, in which there be as many Prophets as there be men and women? This is not the Church of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> in which he ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor:</hi> 12.19. Be all! Prophets? and in which <hi>he gaue</hi> only <hi>ſome Prophets.</hi> Eph: 4.11. But all of you who know, imediately from God, that which no mediat meanes conueigheth vnto you, muſt needs be true Prophets. If this be true, then alſo any Engliſh clown, by the like illumination, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him in the reading of his Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may as well, and better, (becauſe by diuine illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) be aſſured, that all is true which is in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tranſlated Bible; and ſo, by good conſequence, be aſſured that it is a very true Tranſlation; though he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew Greek, nor Hebrew. And indeed your Greek and Hebrew only helps you to conferre the Tranſlation with the Originalls; but <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Originall Copye not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62436:64"/>
beeing for many ages viſible in the world, can be no more conferred with by your Hebritians, then by this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Clown: And if his illumination aſſures him of all that is written in <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Ghoſpell; wee will all, with one conſent, graunt that it may aſſure him as well that all other parts of the Scriptures bee Gods word: what then need you talke of conferring with the Originals, or knowing Greek or Hebrew?</p>

                  <p n="2">2. I return to you, who ſay, God intended by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only to teach vs all neceſſary poincts; which if he hath not done, you make him deficient in an vnworthy manner: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he hath not done it I haue already ſhewed in eighteene neceſſary points: and now I adde, that by Scripture alone he doth not teach vs the true ſenſe of Scripture: And yet the true ſenſe thereof is that which muſt giue ſentence in the deciſion of all controuerſies; the ſenſe is the kernel, the life, the Soule of the text; miſſe that, miſſe all; A wrong and falſe ſenſe is no leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then a falſe text obtruded for a true one. Hence <hi>Tertull:</hi> de Praeſcrip: <hi>The ſenſe adultered is like perilous as the ſtile corrupted</hi> And <hi>S. Ierom</hi> Ep: ad Gal: ſayth. <hi>The Goſpel is not in the word but in the ſenſe; not in the barke, but in the ſappe.</hi> wherefore D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his Conference with Mr. <hi>Hart P.</hi> 58. confeſſeth, <hi>that it is not the shew but the ſenſe of the words, that muſt decide Controuerſies.</hi> So he. It is not then the Text as it ſounds, but the text thus expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which muſt end (as you ſay) all our debates: And yet this expounding thus or thus, is that very thing which firſt makes all our prime debates and Controuerſies; and it is alſo that very thing which maketh them to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. <hi>This I ſtill</hi> inculcate, becauſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This, and the true reaſon of this, is exceedingly to be noted: For it is not the Text, but the text thus or thus expounded, which is to decide controuerſies: not the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62436:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dead letter, but the true ſenſe of it, deliuereth the ſentence of the Holy Ghoſt. The text, as expounded by priuate iudgments, is not to be held Gods vndoubted Word; vnles wee firſt know the interpretation thereof to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true, and agreeing wholy to the mind of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; which to know is a thing wholy impoſſible with out a revelation; and yet, vntill wee come to know this, wee ſhall neither have reaſon to agree in one inward faith interiourly, nor in one outward profeſſion exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly; But ſtill our harts and lips will be devided. This wee ſee, as clearly as noone-day-light, happen among thoſe who take Scripture only for theyr iudge; which all Heretikes did ever vſe, and will ever vſe to do ſo, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape beeing condemned or caſt by any other iudgment-Seate. Hence they all ſtill appeale to Scripture; for then they know beforehand all that can be ſaid, and know alſo by what interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to ſhew, all that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be brought out of Scripture againſt them, not to be ſpoken by God in any ſenſe contrary to the opinion they hould. And thus contrary opinions, grounded in contrary interpretations, are held, and will be held vntill the worlds end; if there be no other Iudge to end them, but the ſentence given by God in the Text of Scripture; not as the text ſounds, but as the Interpreter expoundes. Here with all poſſible care I would have you note, that all the faith which our adverſaries have, relying on their interpretations, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>are fallible, can be but fallible and human: For they believe, all that they believe, becauſe they fully perſwade themſelves, that, God ſayth that thing in the Scripture taken not meerly as the words ſound, but taken as they verily apprehend and iudge the true interpretation to be ſo, or ſo. This is the ground of theyr beleefe in all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62436:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
points; and therefore this is fundamentall to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that as properly as any thing can be called fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall to any Religion: for it is the foundation it ſelfe on which euery ſingle point of theyr beleefe, and theyr whole beleefe in generall is ſo wholy built, that they reſt vpon nothing but this. Where firſt I obſerue, that you and wee muſt needs differ in the moſt fundamemtall point which concerns Religion: for wee beleeue nothing at all becauſe, by our priuate iudgment only, wee iudge it to be the truly interpreted ſenſe of Scripture; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee know it interpreted ſo by the Church, aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt in all her publik interpretations. You will beleeue no one point (for example, that there is a Trinity,) for this reaſon only; becauſe for ſooth you hold the Church fallible in her publik interpretations of Gods word: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wee will not beleeue any point of our faith (for example, the Trinity) vpon that ground; becauſe wee know aſſuredly that our own iudgments, in our priuate interpretations of Scripture, are moſt fallible. Whence it is euident, that in thoſe very points in which wee do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, wee fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally diſagree: becauſe wee diſagree in the very foundation of our beleefe concerning thoſe poincts. Now, in point of beleefe, we muſt mainly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to the truth of what wee beleeue; but to the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und vpon which wee build our beleef. For, if wee think our ſelues to build our beleefe ſecurely, vpon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is deceitfull, (as our own interpretation is, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Churches not:) wee ſhall be ſoon lead to beleeue things which are falſe; as wee ſee a world of People do, by relying on the ſcripture as interpreted by theyr priuate Iudgment. The Turk beleeueth that there is a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Alcoran (which is the Rule of his faith) teacheth
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62436:68"/>
him ſo: Now, becauſe he beleeueth the truth vpon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull foundation; he, vpon the ſame foundation, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the beleefe of a thouſand falſities. Adde to this, that this Iudgment of the interpreter (who according to you is euery priuate man, yea euery priuate woeman, for his or her own ſelfe:) this iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I ſay, is moſt weak, and many points of faith are matters very hard to conceiue, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould; and controuerſies alſo are exceedingly intangled; and the conferring texts with texts, like and vnlike, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſeth vncertainty of hitting right, then it helps to any full aſſured certainty: what then more ſure, then a moſt vnaſſured proceeding, in this interpreter? Again, priuate Iudgments beeing almoſt as various as priuate faces (yea often differing from them ſelues) infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of interpretations muſt needs proceed from infinite priuate mens iudgments, ſo very various. You may ſee this in your Patriarch <hi>Luther;</hi> who, in matters of higheſt moment, is noted no leſſe then <hi>fourſcoore times</hi> to haue taught flatt contradictions: as you may ſee ſhewed in the end of the firſt tome of our learned <hi>Coccius.</hi> Not only your <hi>Martin Luther</hi> thus contradicted him ſelfe in words; but alſo your <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> contradicted him ſelfe in exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior change from Religion to Religion: At one time <hi>he fully iudged</hi> thoſe texts of the Scripture, which ſpeak of the Sacrament of the Body of our Lord, to be truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Roman Catholiks; and ſo he beleeued Chriſts Body to be really preſent, and to be adored in the Sacrament. <hi>After this he iudged moſt ſincerly,</hi> that the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans did truely interpret thoſe texts; and ſo he beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a Lutheran, holding the reall preſence, but denying Chriſts Body to be there adored. <hi>Thirdly after this he moſt ſincerly iudged</hi> the interpretation of thoſe texts giuen by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62436:68"/>
Zuinglians, to be the only true ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt; and then he became a Zuinglian, denying Chriſts Body to be really preſent in the Sacrament; for which <hi>Luther</hi> tearmed him <hi>perfidious: Fourthly, he once more moſt ſincerly iudged Luthers</hi> interpretation of thoſe texts to be the truer ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and once more became a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran: and therefore in his firſt Edition of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vpon the ſixth of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and 26. of <hi>S. Matthew, he asketh pardon of God and the Church for hauing bewitched ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Hereſy of Zuinglius. Fiftly, yet after this he ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely iudged again</hi> Zuinglius his interpretation of thoſe Texts to be the only true one: And this interpretation he did publickly profeſſe and defend <hi>at Cambridge;</hi> to which Vniuerſity he was called out of Germany as a prime Doctor, to helpe vs here in England in our new begun Reformation. And it is to be noted, that, at euery one of theſe his changes, he ſtill vſed <hi>moſt earneſt proteſtations of vndoubted certainty, conceaued from the Scriptures:</hi> as you may ſee in the moſt learned <hi>Brierley in his treatiſe</hi> of <hi>S. Auſtens Religion in the Preface;</hi> where he cites his authors for all theſe changes. To which I adde that after all thoſe changes, he is at laſt affirmed to haue died a Iew, by <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevin in notis Verbi Dei</hi> and <hi>Vlenbergius Cauſa</hi> 12. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for one, who hath firſt beleeued Scripture as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by euery Mans priuate judgment, to be to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man the only ground of all he is to beleiue concerning Chriſt, and his doctrine: and then hath conſidered after this, how groundles a ground this is; and how, if this be the only meanes left by Chriſt for vnity in his Church, his Church is moſt pittifully prouided: for in this moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important point, it cannot but breed a ſtrong temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to fall quite out of loue with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62436:69"/>
in thoſe who will not admitt any thought of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a better ground amongſt vs, where it might be ſo eaſily found.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Queſtionles if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be God as he is; and if he truly loveth theſe ſoules for which he dyed; he would not have failed, to provide them of ſome more aſſured, meanes; to know that true faith without which he will not ſave them; then this meanes is, of leaving them to the Bible as interpreted by each one as he thinks righteſt. What Law-maker in any Common-wealth was ever yet found any where ſo imprudent as only to leave the people of his Common-wealth ſo miſerably provided (for the finall ending all theyr Controverſyes) as they ſhould be, if he did only leave them a Law-book for their ſole and only Iudge in all theyr differences; without any liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudge to expound it with vnappealeable authority. Well now the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Community, which was to be ſpread over the whole face of the Earth; and intended to laſt vntill the conſumation of the world: and therefore this Community, above all others, had the greateſt need of a moſt ſuper-abundantly-ſufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to end all theyr Controverſyes; which do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne theyr temporall, but eternall welfare. A world of Controverſies muſt needs be ſtill riſing in a community concerning ſo many ſorts of people, and thoſe ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further removed from <hi>Chriſts</hi> time vntill the very end of the world. Wherefore this community had been moſt miſerably and pittifully provided for, in poinct of vnity in faith; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have gathered together a moſt heart-diſvnited ſort of people, if in all theyr numberles differences, after all theyr reading of Scriptures, conferring of places and ſuch like Rules as
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62436:69"/>
you preſcribe; they ſhould have no other meanes left them to end thoſe Controverſies, but the written Text of the Bible, to be expounded according as they can gheſſe at the intent of the Holy Ghoſt. True faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the interiour judgment; if then <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſired they ſhould be of one faith, he deſired alſo they ſhould be of one interiour judgment: But how could the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God expect this vnity in the inward judgement, knowing ſo well that every one of theſe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were ſo exceedingly different in framing ſeverall iudgments; and that even after they have vſed all the Rules which you give them.</p>

By this diſcourſe, without going further, thou mayeſt once more ſee the vngrou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>denes of all thy whole beleef, relying only vpon the word of God: as this word is expounded and vnderſtood by thy iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; which in farre eaſier matters hath deceived thee a thouſand times, and may do ſo in this hard matter, in which a world of better vnderſtandings then thyne do vaſtly differ from thee.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62436:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not as it ſounds, nor as expounded by the Church, but as every one in his private judgment doth really think it ought to be expounded. Wherefore vpon the whole matter, it is all one to rely vpon a mans private judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and to rely vpon the Scripture, as interpreted by his own private judgment. See the vaſt variety of Religions lately ſprung vp by following this Principle, in my firſt <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 23. If thou replyeſt that thou doeſt not truſt to, and rely vpon thy judgement; but vpon the ſpirit of God, which thou knoweſt aſſuredly to rule this judgment, ſecuring it from all misvnderſtanding of Gods word: this thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will have many difficulties. Firſt, how canſt thou, without high preſumption aſſume, to thy private ſelfe ſo ſecure an aſſiſtance of the Spirit (aſſuredly preſerving thee from all errour in thy private judgment;) when thou doeſt ſo pertinaciouſly deny, that the Church repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative it ſelfe (when it judgeth in a generall Councel for the whole world of beleevers) is aſſured ſo well in theyr publick judgment as thou art in thy private?

                  <p n="6">6. Wherefore, your laſt refuge is to ſay, that all points neceſſary are clearly ſet down in Scripture; which I have ſhewed (and ſhall further ſhew) to be manifeſtly falſe: And you may even with your fingars touch the falſehood of it, in this moſt neceſſary point, of knowing which is the certain vndoubted true ſenſe of Scripture.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62436:71"/>
For, in things, which are clearly to be ſeen, there vſeth not to be variety (and infinite variety) of judgments: as wee have ſeen there is, in interpreting the neceſſary texts of Scripture: in ſo much as no Deuine, by Scripture only, can conuince an <hi>Arian Cobler,</hi> as I ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>N.</hi> 5. Although this <hi>Cobler</hi> houldeth alſo Scripture for his only iudge. This variety of interpretations (one flatly oppoſite to the other) ſheweth evidently the Scripture in theſe points not to be evidently cleer. Again, if wee mark it, this anſwer is very litle to the purpoſe, in our adverſaries principles: for <hi>firſt,</hi> they teach that our Catholike Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion doth not differ from theyrs in any point fundamentall, or neceſſary to ſaluation: ſecondly, they teach that the Scripture cannot be ſhewed to be clear in points not ſo fully neceſſary for ſaluation. Hence I argue thus; in points wholy neceſſary to ſaluation you and wee all agree; as you ſay: ſo that by this you can inferr no more then, that the Scripture is clear in thoſe points in which wee both agree. What get you by this? Do you ſeperate from the whole Church for other points, which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proue your ſelues, by this ground, to haue clear Scripture for? It is your common doctrine deliuered by D. <hi>Ferne</hi> in his <hi>Sect.</hi> 13. that <hi>againſt publick authority</hi> (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of all Churches, in the whole world, all which you oppoſed in very many importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t points) <hi>there muſt be brought euident demonſtration of clear Scripture.</hi> You do not proue that you bring this, vnleſſe you can proue the Scripture Vniuerſally to be clear in points not neceſſary to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for about theſe (as you ſay) wee only differ. If you pleaſe to ſay then, though Scripture be not clear in all points vnneceſſary, yet it is clear in thoſe in which wee now diſagree; euery child will ſee, that you begge that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62436:71"/>
very thing which is in queſtion. And what argument will you bring, to make vs beleeue that the beſt, and the choiſeſt Doctors that were in any Church, for theſe laſt thouſand and two or three hundered yeares, could not ſee the true ſenſe of a clear plaine and euident text of Scripture which they read euery day? And yet you muſt encreaſe the miracle, and ſay; that all thoſe Doctors of that age in which firſt the true Religion decayed, muſt needs know, that the whole former Church, from Chriſts dayes to theyr dayes, had vnderſtood thoſe clear places iuſt as you vnderſtand them now; that is in theyr true ſenſe. Now, I pray, vpon what record haue you it relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there did fall in the fourth, or fift, or ſixt age, ſuch a thick miſt vpon all the beſt ſeeing eyes of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy age, (about which age alſo none of you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agree;) that no one Doctor could, or would ſee him ſelfe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt the known ſenſe of all former Chriſtianity, in the interpretation thoſe texts, which ſo euidently ſtand for the doctrine of all former Chriſtianity againſt them? Will you haue vs to beleeue this ſtrangeſt wonder of all wonders, without any Record from Antiquity; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon your ſaying that it was ſo.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is yet an other conuincing reaſon, why this clearnes you ſpeak of in Scriptures, to vnfould vnto vs the vndoubted ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt in all neceſſary Controuerſies, cometh to be of no ſeruice, for the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble finding out the true ſenſe by euery priuat man and woeman: to all which you vſe ſtill to ſay: <hi>if you will be with vs, you shall ſee what you do; Wee require your obedience to what wee demonſtrate to be Gods will for you to beleeue and doe,</hi> as D. <hi>Ferne</hi> boaſts <hi>Sect:</hi> 14. Heere wee come to the point to ſee your demonſtration: if you gull vs here you
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62436:72"/>
vndo vs: Make vs then ſee, that by clear demonſtration of Scripture, wee may ſee what God in all neceſſary points requireth of vs to beleeue and to do: and make all of vs men, and woemen, do this. How vaſtly you deceiue vs, I haue ſhewed all ready, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 13. which place I muſt needs intreat the reader to turn to, and read at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely, before he goeth further. There wee haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and that by D. <hi>Ferns</hi> own confeſſion in his <hi>Sect:</hi> 26.) that all things neceſſary are not conteyned expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture: but ſome of them are only thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. But tell mee (great Doctor) be they deducible by all of vs, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you promiſe ſo gloriouſly to make eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this demonſtration? <hi>They be</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>deducible not all by euery one that reades; but it is enough if done by the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and guides which God appointed in his Church to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> What? did you call vs all to be blind folded by you, and not to ſee the demonſtration: but to hear only this newes of it; that it hath been ſeen to be a demonſtrable deduction by your Miniſters? wee do not ſee your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, but your groſſe cheat. Yet (my dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe gulled farre more. Euery Miniſter hath not eyes (how wilt thou know whether thy Miniſter hath or no?) to ſee this Demonſtratiue deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for <hi>Dr. Ferne</hi> addeth <hi>that they muſt be Miniſters vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanes that are needfull</hi> (mark the word <hi>needfull) for that purpoſe; ſuch as is,</hi> 1. <hi>Attention.</hi> 2. <hi>dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the ſearch of the Scripture.</hi> 3. <hi>Collation of places.</hi> 4. <hi>obſeruing the connexions.</hi> 5. <hi>alſo ſincerity and impartiality in the collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or deduction they make.</hi> 6. <hi>alſo prayer and deuotion for asſiſtance in the work.</hi> Alſo, beſides theſe ſix Rules, there be fourteene more to be added; as I ſhewed in the place aboue cited: of which ſome be as impoſſible for the vulgar multitude to vſe

Neither do I ſay any more in this, then your own moſt learned Doctors haue ſaid before mee; to which I adde your moſt learned whitaker <hi>Lib.</hi> de <hi>Sacra Script: P.</hi> 5. 23. where he ſayeth of thoſe who vnderſtand not the Hebrew and Greek; that <hi>they do often erre, and that vnauoidably: Saepe ac neceſſario hallucinantur.</hi> Now bidde vs poor people <hi>Come with you, and wee shall ſee what wee do.</hi> Now indeed wee ſee what wee doe; for wee clearly ſee wee do wee know not what; becauſe wee ſee wee leaue, by your inſtruction, the interpretations of all Councels, and Fathers, ſeconded by the perpetuall practice of all Churches, which God had vpon the face of the Earth, for twelue hundred yeares together, as is confeſſed: and this wee do, to follow, not this euidence which wee are tould wee ſhould ſee with our own eyes to be ſuch; but to follow what ſome Miniſters ſay they ſee to be euident, to witt, thoſe few Miniſters, who are perfectly, skilled in Greek and Hebrew; of whoſe perfect skill wee haue no knowledge of our own; and though wee had, wee do not perfectly know that they haue vſed, in all points they teach vs, theſe twenty Rules which they confeſſe to be <hi>Needfull:</hi> and wee alſo do know that all theſe twenty Rules are confeſſed to be fallible; and wee haue litle hope by twenty fallible meanes, to come to ſee an infallible truth eſtabliſhed; for when wee were boyes at ſchoole, learning a litle Arithmetike, wee were taught, that <hi>naught times naught did makes nothing but naught.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. I haue (I hope) ſhewed thee ſufficiently, that thou canſt not ſee aſſuredly, and vpon thy own knowledge know euidently, which is the true ſenſe of the Scripture. Now I will giue thee a further reaſon thereof, deliuered by one of thy own cheefe Doctors, <hi>Doctor Ieremy Taylor in his diſcourſe of the Liberty of Prophecying, Sect:</hi> 3. where he proueth the vncertainty of arguments deduced (as D. <hi>Ferne</hi> ſpeaks) from Scripture, by the many ſenſes of Scripture; when the Grammaticall ſenſe is found out. For <hi>there is in very many Scriptures a double ſenſe, a Litterall and a Spirituall; and both theſe ſenſes are ſubdiuided: for the Litterall ſenſe is either naturall, or figuratiue; and the Spirituall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times allegoricall, ſometimes Tropologicall; ſometimes there are diuers literall ſenſes in the ſame places:</hi> ſo he. Now it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon the ſecret intention of the Holy Ghoſt, to haue vſed theſe words in ſome one, or two or more of theſe ſenſes. How ſhall wee find out ſo great a ſecret, and that ſo infallibly, as to be vndoubtedly aſſured, of our own knowledge, that wee haue certainly diſcouered this ſecret? Twenty fallible Rules, though wee ſhould vſe them all, as well as a man could, would not bring vs to this infallible aſſurance. Euen your great Doctors (who haue vſed them better then thou canſt hope to doe) haue had <hi>two hundered ſeuerall opinions</hi> about the true ſenſe of theſe four words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62436:73"/>
to be aſſured infallibly, vpon thy own knowledge, that theſe words be to be interpreted figuratiuely; becauſe thou haſt conferred this text with ſome other texts, for example with thoſe texts which tell thee that <hi>Chriſts</hi> words <hi>be ſpirit and life,</hi> and that <hi>The flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> Alas thou haſt obſerued but one of theſe Twenty Rules, which is Conference of one text with another: This Rule is infinitely deceitfull, as the ſame Doctor <hi>Tayler</hi> teacheth thee, who in his next Section ſaith; <hi>Another great pretence</hi> (to iuſtify new Interpretations) <hi>is the conference of places; A thing of ſuch indefinite capacity, that, if there be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of words, variety of ſenſes, alteration of circumſtances, or difference of ſtile amongſt Diuine writers, there is nothing which may be more abuſed by wilfull people, or may more eaſily deceiue the vnwary, or that may amuſe the moſt intelligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers.</hi> What ſhall then become or thee and mee who are none of the moſt intelligent obſeruers? And ſo this Rule alone leaueth vs at a <hi>non plus,</hi> euen though wee had both Greek and Hebrew: For (as the ſame Doctor intimateth) it is a moſt pittifull argument to inferre; <hi>this muſt infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the true ſenſe,</hi> becauſe I can ſhew that <hi>perhaps it may be the true ſenſe.</hi> Again, when your Doctors bidd mee conferre this text with other texts of the Bible: I aske, whether I muſt conferre it only with other places of the ſame Book in which it is written? They will ſay, no; but I muſt conferre it with all other texts of the word of God, written in any Book. <hi>Firſt</hi> this is a vaſt labour, and requireth a vaſt memory to do it, as it ſhould be done, with exquiſite attention. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I haue a queſtion to aske, which I am ſure will poſe you: how ſhall I, or any Doctor of them all, conferre this text with the texts of all other Book of Scripture, ſeeing that no fewer then ſome
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62436:74"/>
twenty Bookes of Scripture haue quite periſhed, and be no where to be found in the whole world? as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 7. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you ſay that by this conferring of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what was obſcure proueth clear: and you marke not, that by the very ſame meanes, what was clear groweth obſcure. What more clear then what <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayd; <hi>If you be circumciſed, Chriſt will profitt you nothing.</hi> Gal: 5. Take this ſo cleare a text, and conferre it with that <hi>Act.</hi> 16:3. <hi>He tooke Timothie, and circumciſed him;</hi> and you will find dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty how the former text can ſtand in full force. Doe you thinke <hi>S. Paul</hi> would make <hi>Chriſt</hi> profit Timothie nothing.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Hence I inferre, that if God had intended the Scripture for our ſole and only Rule of Faith, he would have ſet down in ſome one place all neceſſary points clearly, and diſtinctly; and he would not have left theſe points to be picked out, one out of one Book, an other out of an other, no man directly knoweth where: Yea no man knoweth by Scripture, which points are neceſſary even for himſelfe or for all. Had God intended to make a Booke our only Iudge or Rule, he would have given vs ſuch a book, as ſhould clearly and diſtinctly have ſaid; <hi>theſe points are neceſſary to be beleeved, theſe things are neceſſary to be done.</hi> But now, one man tells vs one thing is neceſſary, an other man ſayth no: The Scripture ſayth neither Yea nor No. Therefore, to thoſe who will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Scripture only, no aſſurance at all can be had of the neceſſity of ſuch points as the Scripture doth not affirme to be neceſſary: For if you have only human reaſon for this neceſſity, this is but a human motive, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull; and beeing thwarted with a contrary reaſon of as apparent probability, my faith now is turned into a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62436:74"/>
doubt. The points which are neceſſary, you commonly ſay to be but few; and that the Scripture ſets them down clearly, as it doth alſo ſet down clearly many other points not neceſſary. Whence the vaſt number of thoſe not-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points clearly ſet down doth infinitly increaſe the difficulty of finding out theſe few which are neceſſary: ſeeing that they ly ſo ſcattered a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d intermingled in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berles number of the not-neceſſary. For ſome of theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points are ſet down here, in the begining of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſome one, ſome two or three books after; ſome other hard by that, ſome other a huge way of; and ſo from Gen. to the <hi>Apoc.</hi> Yea, why not further then the <hi>Apoc.</hi> for it is a meer gueſſe made at randome, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture that in thoſe twenty bookes of Scripture, which be quite loſt, no one neceſſary point ſhould be ſet down plainly, which is not ſett down plainly in theſe books which wee haue. At leaſt you ſay this without Scripture; and therefore, by your own principles, you ſhould not ſay it: for your part beeing affirmatiue, (affirming that no one neceſſary point was plainly ſet down in thoſe books which be loſt, which is not plainly ſet down in theſe which wee haue;) you muſt proue what you ſay, and that by Scripture: For I am ſure you cannot proue it by Tradition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither in your, nor our principles, it can be proued. Again; the Bible, as it is now, maketh a Book ſo bigge, that the farre greater part of the world, taken vp with ſo many neceſſary affayers, cannot in a very long ſpace of time read ouer this book ſo often, and ſo exactly carry a-way all the clear texts thereof, as to be able to conferre one place with an other: For before they come to the other, which is perhaps in the Apocalyps, that text, which they did read in Geneſis, is out of theyr mind: or if that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62436:75"/>
text be not, ſome other may be, euen at a time in which they ſhould haue moſt obſerued it. Beſides this, what am I the neerer if I ſpend all this labour in my Engliſh Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Bible; of the right Tranſlation of which I neither haue, nor can haue full aſſurance, if I be not a very great ſcholler; as hath been ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. Yea, though I be ſo great that one among one hundred thouſand is not greater; (for I vnderſtand Greek and Hebrew moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:) yet, for all this, I neither haue, nor can haue full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the Greek and Hebrew Copyes which I vſe, be the true Copyes of the true word of God; as hath been ſhewed <hi>Section</hi> 5. Gods wiſdome directs him to the beſt meanes, to compaſſe his intention: Wee euen in our ordinary wiſdome, if wee intend to ſet forth a Book, which ſhould end all neceſſary Controuerſies, would all do our beſt indeauour to compriſe in halfe a dozen Chapters at the moſt, all theſe few fundamentall points; for theſe points you teach to be but few: and wee would not make thoſe poor ſoules (which wee deerly loued) at the peril of theyr own damnation, to ſeek out, all the whole Bible ouer, theſe few points which are confeſſed not to be ſo eaſy to be found out, but by ſome choice Miniſters obſeruing all that long way, which is from the firſt of Geneſis to the very laſt verſe of the Apocalips, no fewer then twenty Rules, and many of them very hard ones to obſerue at all times, in all paſſages of ſo long a iourney. And yet there is, to the full, as great reaſon, why thoſe twenty bookes more, which are loſt; as all theſe which wee now haue, ſhould be conſulted: beeing God gaue vs all the whole written word for our guide. God did not proceed thus euen in the ould law in points of farre, and incomparable farre leſſe concernment; to witt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62436:75"/>
in points of meer Ceremony: For euery litle particular ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony which he exacted is, with moſt minute exactnes ſet down in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of not many leafes: Yet farre few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would conteyne all points neceſſary to Saluation, if they be ſo few as you hould.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wee then, by our own judgment, are notable to deduce demonſtratively all thoſe truths and verities, which are wholy neceſſary to our Salvation: But inſteed of doing this by our own ſelues, and vpon our owne knowledge, with demonſtrative ſecurity; wee are in plain tearmes tould by the beſt Proteſtant Doctors, that this cannot be done by vs even in all theſe neceſſary points; no nor done by all our miniſters, without the vſe of many Rules, which the farre greater part of them cannot vſe. What then ſhall wee do? Which way ſhall wee turne ourſelves? Is there no better way, then to truſt thoſe choice, but ſtill fallible Miniſters; vſing ſtill only fallible Rules; and infallibly ſure to contradict one an other? I will tell thee firſt what thy own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant prime Maiſters in Scripture do plainly tell thee, I mean thoſe Renowned Doctors who now, at this very time, are ſetting forth that ſo famous Bible, of ſo many learned languages. Theſe Doctors, peruſing night and day the beſt Originall Copyes of the Bible that be to be had, may as ſafely be followed by thee, as any Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thou knoweſt. Theſe men in the Preface to theyr great work, which I citted <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 8. hauing firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cleer that controverſy about the truth of the Copyes of Gods true word which they give vs; they then ſpeak thus: <hi>The whole Controverſy beeing about the true ſence of the Scripture, delivered by tranſlations every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, wee have ready at hand the judgment almoſt of that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62436:76"/>
whole Church which is Catholike</hi> (or vniverſall) <hi>as well in reſpect of its beeing in all places, as its beeing in all times; which Church vnfoldeth to vs the places in controverſy. To whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (mark this) <hi>he who will not ſubmit himſelfe, truly he sheweth himſelfe to be a man of no judgment, and he is ſcarce worth the name of a man, much leſſe of a Chriſtian.</hi> So they <hi>fol.</hi> 4. This is a different leſſon from what D. <hi>Ferne</hi> taught thee. But it hath better authority, Catholique Antiquity beeing altogether of one mind in this point. I will tell thee this out of a moſt approved Doctor of the primitive Church, and no man doth ſo much as queſtion whether the words which I ſhall cite out of him be his or no; He hath but one litle book in all; It is <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis,</hi> who lived in the fifth age, he writeth thus: <hi>Do Heretikes vſe the teſtimonies of Scripture? Yes indeed do they, and that moſt vehemently; you shall ſee them fly through all the ſacred Booke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Churches upon the face of the Earth. But I muſt haue a Church, vpon whoſe authority wee all ſecurely may and alſo muſt rely, in interpreting the Scriptures, as <hi>S. Vincent</hi> ſpeaketh; and that Church, muſt of neceſſity be granted to be infallible: but no Church can be infallible which hath not this condition, that it houldeth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe to be infallible; as I ſhall demonſtrate <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. <hi>n.</hi> 2. which condition agreeing to no one Church but the Roman (as is manifeſt;) this holy Father, and all the reſt (who bidde vs ſtill to doubts and Controuerſies about the Scriptures, and theyr ſeuerall interpretations rely vpon the Church, and take her doctrine for our warrant) do bidde vs rely vpon that Church which was held, and truly held by all to be infallible. And ſo all very well know that they meant the Roman Church, and no Church differing in Communion from her; becauſe this condition agreed to none but Her. When this was ſo vndiſputably out of all queſtion, among all ſuch as were then counted Catholikes then they thought it enough to ſay; <hi>Rely on the Church:</hi> without ſaying, <hi>Rely on the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi> So wee Catholicks, ſpeak to this very day, neuer adding the <hi>Roman,</hi> but for our aduerſaries ſake among whom wee liue: iuſt as Engliſh men ſay, <hi>The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament decided ſuch a thing;</hi> meaning the <hi>Parliament of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> which all Engliſh in England perfectly vnderſtand without adding any other wordes: But the Engliſh (who liue among French men) when in France they ſay, <hi>The Parliament decreet ſuch a thing;</hi> they muſt of neceſſity adde, <hi>the Parliament of England,</hi> to be rightly vnderſtood of the French men there; who otherwiſe might think they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſome French Parliaments.

now in theſe dayes vnderſtand that pure ould Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike language ſtill common to all vs of the Roman Communion: <hi>The Church decreed this; Follow the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church; rely on the interpretation of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> when wee expreſſe our ſelues thus by this word <hi>Church,</hi> without adding the word <hi>Roman;</hi> wee are known, by all who be of the true Church, only to mean the Roman Church, and thoſe of her Communion: Yet euen wee in theſe ſtrange new times to be vnderſtood by theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh (as I may ſay) and new-found people of our dayes, muſt needs adde the word <hi>Roman;</hi> or elſe they will not vnderſtand vs to ſpeak of that Church, of which wee are by all our own Church moſt perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſpeak. And Antiquity by the name of <hi>the Church</hi> ſtill meant the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> iuſt as wee do: and iuſt as wee ſpeak among our ſelues, ſo then ſpoake <hi>the holy</hi> graue Fathers, whoſe Catholik language was nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtod by that forreignner, who, more bouldy then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly, ſaid <hi>that, none of the ancient Chriſtians beleeued the church of Rome to be a Guide or Iudge of all Controuerſies in Chriſtianity, becauſe Tertullian, Vincentius Lerinenſis and others giuing Rules to know Heretikes, forgot this maine and cleareſt Rule:</hi> whereas you ſee by the woords I haue cited, that <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis</hi> tells you as clearly as I do doe, that to auoid hereſy you muſt, in vnderſtanding the Scripture, follow the interpretation <hi>of the Church,</hi> as a ſecure guide and interpreter in all Controuerſies ariſing about the ſenſe of Scriptures; ſhewing it a note of hereſy to do the contrary.

The Creed of S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath ever ben admitted by all ſucceeding true beleeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and your Engliſh Church doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to beleeve it, and vſed to read it in theyr Common Prayer. In this Creed you profeſſe your ſelves to beleeve ſeverall points no where conteyned in the Bible in plain termes: <hi>As that God the Father is not begotten;</hi> that <hi>God the Sonne is not made, but begotten by his Father only:</hi> that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is neither made nor begotten; but doth proceed, and that from the Father and the Sonne.</hi> And that <hi>he who will be ſaved, muſt beleeve this.</hi> For this is an Article of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, <hi>which faith without a man houldeth entierly and inviolably, without all doubt he shall perish eternally.</hi> All
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62436:78"/>
this is in that Creed profeſſed by vs; and yet not one of thoſe ſeverall points conteyned in it, can be ſhewed to be conteyned in Scripture, no not for the Subſtance of them in any ſuch texts as clearly decide the matter. Note by the way, how you plainly contradict your ſelves, who ſubſcribe to the truth of all that hath been ſayd of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that there is to ſalvation, to beleeve all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid particulars here expreſſed by <hi>S.

                  <p n="2">2. To this point (for I let all theſe ſeverall points paſſe for only one) I might adde, that in the ſame Book of Common Prayer you in an other Creed beleeve, that <hi>Chriſt is of one Subſtance with the Father;</hi> and that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne:</hi> For which words the Grecian Church houlds vs all Heretikes; and yet your Doctors of the Engliſh Church will needs hould them a true Church. But that which I preſſe is, that wee are bound to give an infallible aſſent to this article <hi>of God the Sonnes beeing of one Subſtance with the Father:</hi> But you, who will give no infallible aſſent to any thing but Gods written word, cannot poſſibly give infallible aſſent to this Article; Which is no where clearly ſet down in Scripture, but an <hi>Arian Cobler</hi> will eaſely putt off all the texts you can bring; as I ſhewed <hi>S.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 5. But not to ſtand conteſting about the clearnes of theſe Tects, let this point paſſe joyned to the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For another point not conteyned in Scripture, I bring the <hi>Baptiſme of Children;</hi> which is wholy neceſſary to the Salvation of Children.

that <hi>the third part of Mankind dyeth before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of theyr age be ended.</hi> The third part then of Mankind is concerned in this one point, of giving Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full baptiſme to them when they are Children: and yet, a point ſo neceſſary to the Salvation of many, is no where plainly ſet down in Scripture. To this <hi>D. Ferne</hi> anſwers, <hi>S.</hi> 24. <hi>Baptiſme of Children, as to the practiſe of it, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned expreſſely in Scripture;</hi> (id eſt) <hi>it is no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done, or ſayd that they did doe it: But the ground and neceſsity of it are ſufficiently delivered in Scripture; and that is enough for the doing of it. And that the Arguments from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and others alledged, do ſufficiently shew.</hi> Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> the Doctor tells vs, that he (<hi>Lib. de Baptiſme c.</hi> 8.) ſayth <hi>that the Arguments for Childrens Baptiſme out of Scripture cannot be avoided; and that it is a thing evident in Scripture.</hi> But yet (ſayth <hi>D. Fern.</hi>) when he treateth of Traditions (<hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>de Verbo Dei Cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>This thing of Childrens Baptiſme muſt be one of them, that it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and not conteyned in Scripture. This is not ingenuous, nor Conſcionable.</hi> So <hi>D. Fern;</hi> but farre leſſe conſcionably: For <hi>Bellarmin L.</hi> 7. <hi>de Bapt.</hi> in all that eight Chapter hath no word in favour of the evidence of Scripture for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Children; Yea, almoſt at every text that he cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he ſheweth, that text to have noe force out of our adverſaries Mouth. Of one argument out of Scripture he ſayth indeed; that, as it cometh from vs; (which words <hi>D. Ferne</hi> conceales) it is ſo manifeſt that it cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded; and that is, that Circumciſion was ſo clear a figure of Baptiſme, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> called it Circumciſion; But Circumciſion was given to Infants, therefore Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme may. But here <hi>Bellarmin</hi> may well mean that this argument, as it cometh from vs, cannot be eluded; to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62436:79"/>
witt, by that vſual ſhift, by which the Anabaptiſts can eaſely elude it when it cometh from Lutherans and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts: whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had ſhewed to teach that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Baptiſme was only a Sermon; which agreeth not to Infants: This evaſion cannot any way elude this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as it cometh from vs. This is all can be convinced out of this place of <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> But there be other ſolid wayes of avoyding all force of this argument, even as it cometh from vs. For firſt, every Sacrament muſt not be received by all thoſe, by whom the figure of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might lawfully be taken; Sinners did lawfully eat Manna, but they cannot lawfully receave the Euchariſt; of which Manna was a figure: So alſo Circumciſion was neceſſary for the male-children of the Iewes only, and that not before the eight day; and Baptiſme is now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary both for the male and female Children of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, and that before either the eight, or ſecond day, if there be danger of death: The conſequence then houldeth not from the figure to the thing figured. Neither is that a neceſſary conſequence which is drawn from baptizing of whole families. For firſt, as wee read that whole families were baptized, ſo wee read that whole families beleeved. <hi>Himſelfe beleeved and his whole family. Io.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 53. Will you evidently inferre from hence, that the litle Children, not yet of yeares of diſcretion, did beleeve? They then only beleeved who were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: So will Anabaptiſts ſay, they only were baptized in theſe families who were capable of firſt beleeving, and anſwering for themſelves. Secondly, in many families all the Children which are alive, are above ſeven yeares ould, and of age to beleeue: There be many families of new married people, who as yet haue no children; or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62436:80"/>
thoſe they had be dead: Many are barren, and will neuer have any. Now <hi>Mr. Doctor</hi> as theſe two cheefe places (brought by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or others) do afford you noe clear principle, from which you can euidently deduce the neceſſity of Infants Baptiſme; or that it is good and valid, and not to be iterated; or that theyr parents are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to procure it for theyr litle children: ſo other leſſe ſtrong places will leſſe helpe you to the euident inference of any of theſe points, which you hould neceſſarily to be beleeued. I am not ſatisfied by beeing tould, other men cite texts which doe proue this euidently: You muſt cite them, and ſhew them to be evident. The beſt text, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des theſe, is this, <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; he cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen, Io:</hi> 3.5. but how many ſhifts the Anabaptiſts haue, to auoid the force of this text, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you; and you ſhall ſee one preſently.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Much more ingenuous and Conſcionable is your <hi>D. Taylor</hi> in his Defenſe of Epiſcopacy, <hi>S.</hi> 9. <hi>P.</hi> 100. where he ſayth; <hi>Baptiſme of Infants is of ordinary necesſity to all that euer cryed; and yet the Church hath founded this Rite vpon the Tradition of the Apoſtles. And wiſe men do eaſily obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that the Anabaptiſts can, by the ſame probability of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re enforce a necesſity of Comunnicating Infants, vpon vs; as wee do of baptizing, vpon them.</hi> For as wee preſſe them with that text; <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the Spirit; he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> ſo they preſſe vs for the neceſſity of Infants Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, by the text which followeth but three Chapters after the former: <hi>Verily Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay vnto you, except you eat of the flesh of the Sonne of Man, and drink his blood, you haue no life in you. D. Taylor</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; <hi>And therefore a great Maſter of Geneva, in a book he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62436:80"/>
writ againſt the Anabaptiſts, was forced to fly to Apoſtolicall traditive ordination.</hi> Here is the very thing ingenuouſly confeſſed which wee labour to prove; that wee muſt truſt the Churches Tradition for this point: the neceſſity of which is ſo great, that he addeth; <hi>They that deny this are, by the iuſt Anathema of the Catholike Church, confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for heretikes.</hi> The Pelagians were ever account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heretikes, even in this reſpect, that they (as <hi>S. Auſten</hi> witneſſeth Hereſi, 88.) taught; <hi>Although Infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be not baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they shall poſſeſſe an eternall and bleſſed life; though it be but of the kingdome of God.</hi> Thoſe Proteſtants are farre boulder, who admitt them euen into the kingdome of heaven it ſelfe. The doctrine of the ancient Fathers is ſo manifeſtly againſt this doctrine, that <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelfe ſayth; (<hi>Inſtit. lib</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 20. <hi>It was vſuall many ages ſince, even almoſt from the begining of the Church, that in danger of death, Lay People might baptize.</hi> So he. <hi>And to ſay the contrary, were to croſſe all antiquity;</hi> as your Bilſon confeſſeth in his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at Hampton Court. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſayth no leſſe in his 5.

                  <p n="5">5. To theſe, I might adde the Milevetan Councel; in which <hi>S.

                     <hi>adverſus Donat. de Baptiſm. Parvulorum</hi>) ſpeaking of this point; <hi>That which the Vniverſall Church houldeth, and was not inſtituted by Councels, but yet allwayes held, is moſt rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued to be delivered down to vs by no other then Apoſtolicall Authority.</hi> If Apoſtolicall Authority be not a ſure ground for beleefe; vpon what ground have wee receiued all our writings as divine? This Authority ſecured <hi>S. Auſten</hi> in the beleefe of a neceſſary point not conteyned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The like authority may alſo as well ſecure vs all in thoſe other neceſſary points, which wee have ſhewed to be conteyned in no Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. What I have ſaid will be much confirmed by an other neceſſary point, which alſo is not conteyned in any Scripture. It is a damnable herely to affirme that thoſe who were baptized by Heritikes, ought to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again. This controverſy was moved in the dayes of <hi>S. Cyprian;</hi> and he was a man as able to ſee that which was clearly ſet down in Scripture, as any of you all: Yet, as appeares by his firſt Book of Epiſtles (<hi>Ep.</hi> 6.) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, he did really judge the Scripture to teach, that all thoſe were to be rebaptized, who had been baptized by heretikes. On this ground he held that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And for the ſame opinion, ſaith <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis,</hi> there ſtood <hi>ſo great force of witt, ſuch torrents of eloquence, ſo great a number af patrons, ſo great apparance of truth, ſo many Oracles of Scripture though misinterpreted.</hi> How come they to be overthrown? He tells you a litle before; <hi>Then Pope</hi> Stephen <hi>of bleſſed memory, the Bishop of the Apoſtolike Sea, together with his fellow Bishops, yet more then any other, did reſiſt them; eſteeming it, as I think, a worthy thing, if he did ſurpaſſe all the reſt in devotion of Faith, as he ſurpaſsed them in the Authority of his place. In fine in that Epiſtle of his, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62436:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ſent into Africa, he decreed with theſe words: That nothing ought to be innovated; but that to be reteyned which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down to vs.</hi> Hence, ſaith this holy Father, the end of the buſines was that; <hi>Antiquity kept poſſeſsion.</hi> And he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>ſtrange change of things. The Authors of this ſelfe ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion are judged Catholikes, and theyr followers Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. The Maiſters of it are abſolved, and the diſciples condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> So he: For it was not a neceſſary point of beleefe, before the Church had declared this opinion to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true faith, becauſe it was contrary to Tradition; now in a Councel examined by the Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be full and ſtrong enough to aſſure vs of the Apoſtles autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this point. And ſo <hi>S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> and others did hould the contrary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and were not Heretiks: but all thoſe who, after this declaration, oppoſed this tradition thus exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and proved for Apoſtolicall, were, for that very oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch a Tradition adjudged heretikes. Neither were they before adjudged to be Heretikes for theyr oppoſing the Scripture as clear in that point. No ſuch thing was ever ſo much as objected againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Hence that great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican Doctor S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> ſpeaking of this very point of Rebaptization, writeth thus, <hi>De vnitate Eccl. c.</hi> 22. <hi>This is neyther openly nor evidently read</hi> (in Scripture) <hi>either by you or by mee: Yet if there were any wiſe man, of whom our Saviour had given teſtimony, and that he should be conſulted in this queſtion; wee should make no doubt</hi> (Mark this all you who oppoſe the infallibility of the Church) <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what he should ſay; leaſt wee should ſeeme not ſo much to gainſay him, as to gainſay Chriſt, by whoſe teſtimony he was recommended. Now Chriſt beareth witnes to his Church.</hi> Marke alſo this reaſon, and conferre it with all thoſe teſtimonies given by Scripture to the Church, which I

And yet this point is ſo farre from beeing clearly put down in Scripture, that, ſtanding meerly to the ſole iudgment of Scripture, wee can ſhew farre clearer texts for ſtill obſerving the <hi>Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> then for the lawfulnes of working vpon that day, and the vnlawfulnes of working vpon the Sunday: for neyther of theſe have ſo much as one clear text; but the ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Satterday (for all thoſe who hould Scripture the only Rule of faith and neceſſary practices) hath many texts, wholy Vnanſwerable; if this main Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy betwen vs and the Sabbatharians be to be tried by Scripture as the only Iudge.

Who tooke a way the ſanctification of it, given by God himſelfe; and given for a reaſon, which is as obliging now as ever? Give me a text, which telleth vs (and that clearly) that this Sanctification was ever taken away. If you contend, that a new Sanctification was giuen to the Sunday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Saviour did reſt that day; let it be ſo, to the honour of his holy name: but where do you read, that, at the giving of this new Sanctification (for which alſo you have no clear text) the former ſanctification gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſeventh day, on which God reſted, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from that day? Again, the day of our Saviours Aſcenſion to heaven was vpon the thurſday, and that may, exceeding properly, be called the finall periode of all his actions: what clear text of Scripture tells you, that any particular ſanctification was given to the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in honour of our Saviours Reſurrection, more then
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62436:85"/>
was given to the Thurſday in the honour of his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But ſtanding to the new Scripture only, I will ſhew that wee have ſtronger texts, reſting in the ſtrength of the text only, (as you will have vs,) for ſtill ſanctifying the ſeventh day or Satterday; then for Sunday. I will give you text for text; and let any reaſonable man judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the text be not more clear for Satterday, then for Sunday. I have in the Revelations, that S. <hi>Iohn was in Spirit vpon our Lords day;</hi> that is Sunday. What then? Is every day to be ſanctified, by abſteyning all the world over from all worke, becauſe <hi>S. Iohn</hi> had a Revelation on that day; as alſo he had on many other dayes? O but hence it is clear that there was ſuch a Day as our Lords day: ſo it is. But how do you prove from hence; that the Sanctification given to Satterday was taken from that day? Or that there was given a Command to all the world not to worke vpon that day which was called our Lords day? How prove you that by Scripture only; Or that it was not the day of the Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion, or <hi>Chriſt</hi>-maſſe day which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> called our Lords day? Now give vs as good an anſwer (if you can) to the text I ſhall bring for ſtill keeping the Satterday. Wee are ſtill obliged to keepe all thoſe Commandements which our Sauiour did bidde vs keep with his own mouth; But he did with his own mouth bidde vs keep the whole Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or thoſe ten Commandements given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the very ſenſe which the Iewes vnderſtood them; Who did vnderſtand, that by <hi>Remembring to ſanctify the Sabboth day,</hi> they were obliged to ſanctify the Satterday. I proue what I have ſaid out of the 10. of <hi>S. Matt:</hi> where wee read that one came to our Sauiour ſaying; <hi>what good shal I do,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62436:85"/>
that I may have life euerlaſting?</hi> Our Sauiour anſwered; <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements.</hi> And when that man replyed to know <hi>what Commandements</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour meant? out deer Lord did clearly explicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to mean all the Commandements of the Decalogue given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> thoſe very Commandements which this man knew very well, as appeares alſo by <hi>Mark</hi> 10. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke</hi> 18. You ſee here the very Author of our new Law, with his owne mouth, requiring no leſſe the keeping of this Commandement, as neceſſary for our entrance into life everlaſting, then the keeping of any other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Give mee your ſecond text for the Sunday, and I will returne a more clear one for the Satterday. Your beſt text is <hi>Act:</hi> 20 <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And vpon the firſt day of the weeke when the diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached vnto them, ready to depart on the morrow.</hi> Hence (will you ſay) it appeares, that the firſt Chriſtians were accuſtomed to Communicate vpon the firſt day of the week; which was Sunday. I anſwer firſt, that it is not clear out of the text that they vſed to do ſo; but that they did ſo that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sunday: of which a very good reaſon may be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the words following, telling vs that, <hi>S Paul was ready to depart on the morrow.</hi> Wherefore thoſe firſt fervent Chriſtians might all aſſemble themſelues to communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of ſo great an Apoſtle before his departure; and they beeing aſſembled, the Zelous <hi>S. Paul</hi> made them a Sermon: but you have no where that he preached every Sunday. But I have a clear text for his preaching every Satterday. <hi>For he diſputed in the Synagogue every Sabboth and he exhorted the Iewes and the Greeks. Act.</hi> 18. Again no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they aſſembled to communicate that day before <hi>S.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62436:86"/>
Pauls</hi> departure, becauſe they were vſed then to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate every day, as many Doctors ſay, or wonderfull fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as is ſtrongly gathered by that text, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.46. <hi>and they continuing dayly</hi> (mark the word <hi>dayly) with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple, breaking bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how doth theyr commnicating vpon Sunday take away the Sanctification which God himſelfe gave to the ſeuenth day; ſetting that day a part from all ſervile work? Again do you think they never worked on that day of theyr Communion, who communicated dayly or exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently? Is theyr communicating once vpon a Sunday enough to prove, that all the world muſt never more worke on the Sunday? And that, from that day, it ſhall be ever lawfull to work on the Satterday? Is ſuch a text clear enough to aboliſh a precept clearly confirmed by the mouth of the Author of the new Law? My ſecond text for ſtill keeping Satterday, is farre clearer, out of 1. <hi>Cor:</hi> 7:19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and prepuce is nothing, but the Obſervation of the Commandments of God;</hi> that is the thing wee muſt now looke after, if wee will have life everlaſting. Behould here that great Apoſtle of the new Law doth tell vs, that even then <hi>when Circumciſion was</hi> quite aboliſhed and made <hi>nothing,</hi> yet the obſervation of the Commandements (of which the ſanctifying the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day, or Satterday, was one) did ſtill ſtand good, and in its full obſervance: ſo that wee have now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour him ſelfe, and three of the fower Evangeliſts, and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> for the obſervation of the ſeuenth day, as much as for the keeping of the other Commandements.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let vs hear your laſt text; for you have but three. It is 1. <hi>cor.</hi> 16. <hi>Now concerning the collections for the Saincts, as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even ſo do yee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62436:86"/>
vpon the firſt day of the week;</hi> (that is Sunday) <hi>let every one of you lay by him in ſtore as God hath proſpered him, that there be no gathering when I come.</hi> A very weake place to aboliſh an ould known and ſtill obſerved Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, confirmed by Chriſts mouth; and to bring in a new obligation vpon all the world forever. I pray marke, that it is not ſo much as ſaid, that theſe monyes were to be gathered when the people did meete at the Church vpon Sundayes: but, <hi>Let every one lay vp by himſelfe in ſtore;</hi> for which work ſome one day of the week was to be appointed; <hi>S. Paul</hi> thought fitt to appoint the firſt day for a pious beginning. But how will you deduce from hence by evident conſequence (as you muſt) that he gave them leave to worke the day before, and obliged them, and all others not to worke that day, vntill the worlds end? Neither this, nor any other place can be brought out of the whole Bible, from which this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be evidently inferred. And now comes my turne, to give you a third and farre more evident text, for the ſtill ſanctifying the Sabboth or ſeventh day: For my text ſhall ſhew, that ſtanding to Scripture only, the ſeventh day was of command to be obſerved long after <hi>S. Paul</hi> did ſay thoſe words; and long after the practice of Communicating vpon Sundayes was in the Church. My Text is <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>But pray you that your flight be not in the Winter, neither on the ſabboth day.</hi> Hence our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our foretels clearly the deſtruction of Ieruſalem (which was to happen in the year of our Lord 73:) that is forty yeares after the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Then, if ever, a nun would thinke the command for the obſervation of the Sabbath, or ſeuenth day, to have been aboliſhed; ſo that it could not be prophaned: and yet our Sauour did
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62436:87"/>
bidde his Apoſtles, (for to them he ſpoke theſe words;) <hi>pray that this flight might not he vpon the Sabbaoth or ſeuenth day,</hi> to auoid the prophanation of that day; on which indeed Ieruſalem was taken, and pillaged. And there was, beſides a perpetuall maſſacring, a perpetuall pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and carrying theyr goods to places of ſecurity; as alſo a perpetuall flight of thoſe Iewes which could fly, and carry away theyr goods if they could, or endeauor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry them or ſweating with inceſſant labour to hide them, by which actions the prophanation might ſeem to be committed. Therefore all the places alledged before hand do not convince, that the obligation of not prophaning the ſabbaoth day was taken away: as alſo they convince no new obligation of not working vpon the Sunday to be brought in. For both theſe things I ask for Scripture, and nothing but Scripture: for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our purpoſe to bring reaſons, why the ſabbaoth might be taken away; and this obligation of not work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the Sunday might be introduced: But you, who affirme not the poſſibility only of the fact, but the reall fact of aboliſhing Satterday, and of inſtituting Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; you, I ſay, muſt prove both theſe things with clear texts, Or elſe your meere diſcourſes and reaſonings will not be halfe ſo good arguments, as our conſtant Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, which you abſolutely deny to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver down to vs any neceſſary obligation, not clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture. Your own Doctor Taylor in his Defenſe of Epiſcopacy, p. 100: confeſſeth the plaine truth. <hi>For</hi> that (ſayth he, ſpeaking of the keeping of the Sunday) <hi>in the new Teſtament wee have no precept; and nothing but the Example of the primitive diſciples: at Geneva they were once about changing Sundayes feaſt into a Thursday, to shew theyr
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62436:87"/>
Chriſtian Liberty.</hi> So he. Had the contrary been plainly ſet down, your ſo illuminated Bretheren of Geneva ſhould have ſeen it. Give mee then infallible texts, and not falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſes concerning the abrogating of the ſatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and inſtitution of the Sunday feaſt in place of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But I have a new difficulty in this matter, which is objected by no body that I know of, becauſe it is not very obuious. My difficulty is this; that wee are bound vnder pain of damnation, to keep our Sunday in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not only not expreſſed in any clear Scripture, but alſo againſt the vſuall manner of keeping the Sabbaoth, and all feſtivall dayes, expreſſed in clear Scripture. For, according to clear Scripture we are to beginne the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth or feaſt on the Euening before, and to end it the next euening: as is clear out of the twentith three Chapter of Leviticus, where all the ould ſabbaoths and feaſts, and the manner of keeping of them are put down; <hi>From Euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Euening shall you celebrate your ſabbaoths.</hi> It was then forbidden, vnder pain of damnation, to work on fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after the evening: in ſo much that a taylor, ſhoe mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, weaver &amp;c. who ſhould have continued working for any long time betweene ſunſett and twelue a-clock at night, ſhould have been damned for his labour: and yet at the next Euening he might lawfully have worked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till mid night: But I hope there is no ſuch thing held law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full on Sunday after the euening; neither is it vnlawfull to do any, though never ſo laborious worke, vpon ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening vntil mid night. Here then you have an other obligation vnder pain of damnation, which is not plainly put downe in Scripture; but delivered vnto vs by the tradition of the ſame Church, which deliuereth the obligation of faſting in Lent vnto vs. Wherefore none of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62436:88"/>
you all can ſhew any ground, vpon which any obligation of keeping the Sunday, and keeping of it in this manner (which I now ſpecified) can be grounded ſolidly; but vpon the very ſelfe ſame ground wee will as ſolidly gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und the obligation of keeping Lent with a faſt of precept (as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 8. as much as Sunday is a feaſt of precept. This argument will trouble <hi>D. Ferne</hi> who §. 13. moſt inconſequently to his other principles, houldeth the obligation of keeping the Lords day, made plainly known vnto vs by Tradition only: And yet houldeth that in the Scripture only all neceſſary obligations are ſett down plainly: plain contradiction.</p>

ſpooke theſe words, <hi>Theſe things I ſay vnto you that you may be ſaved,</hi> did conteyne alon a clear expreſſion of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular neceſſary points diſtinctly putting them all down? How then doth it follow, that becauſe the Iewes did think (and perhaps truly think) to find that which might ſave them in the Scripture, therefore the Scripture did conteyne alone a clear expreſſion of all particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary points, diſtinctly putting them all down? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you muſt not vnderſtand that ſhort ſpeech made by our Sauiour to have ſufficed to Salvation, by expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſtinctly all particular points neceſſary: but becauſe it did ſuffice to bring them to the knowledge of the true Meſſias, whom they acknowledging might, by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtruction, know diſtinctly all particular neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry points: ſo the Scripture did ſuffice to Salvation, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing clearly enough that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the world; whom they could not but beleeve if they would beleeve Moſes: <hi>For had ye beleeved Moſes, ye would have beleeved mee, for he wrote of mee; ſayth</hi> our Lord in the ſame Chapter <hi>v.</hi> 46. beleeving then our Sauiour they ſhould from him (and his Church after him) receive full inſtruction in every particular neceſſary point. But <hi>D. Fern</hi> vrgeth this place wonderfull weakely; becauſe (ſaith he) they might know all things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (by Scripture only,) therefore he bids them <hi>ſearch the Scripture,</hi> and they ſhould find <hi>they teſtified of him.</hi> A weak conſequence to prove that they might know all neceſſary points out of Scripture, becauſe they might know this one point or our Sauiours beeing the true Meſſias. For it is no Conſequence, This one point is clear in Scripture; therefore all other neceſſary points are clear in Scripture. My ſecond anſwer is, <hi>Go and ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:62436:89"/>
now and you ſhall finds Salvation in them; for they will clearly Send you to the Church for your particular inſtruction in all points neceſſary; as I ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>Thirdly ſearch the Scriptures and you shall find Salvation in them;</hi> but not in them as expovnded by every man for him ſelfe (for theſe very men found not Salvation by them as they vnderſtood them;) but you ſhall find Salvation by them as expovnded by the publike interpretation of the Church. And as it is no conſequence, <hi>Chriſt</hi> did bid the Iewes Search thoſe Scriptures which they had then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in them, they ſhould find clearly putt downe, that one point of his beeing the Meſſias; therefore thoſe Scriptures and all the new Teſtament (of which no one word was then written) are affirmed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne all points now neceſſary, and to put all down cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly: ſo alſo it is no conſequence, <hi>Chriſt</hi> bidde vs <hi>ſearch the Scriptures;</hi> Therefore wee are to attend to them alone, and not to attend alſo to the voice of his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bidding vs <hi>hear him;</hi> nor to the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> him ſelfe teſtifying of himſelfe; nor to the voice of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which he calleth <hi>a teſtimony greater then Iohn.</hi> Nor are wee to attend to the voice of Iohn, although he was ſent on ſet purpoſe <hi>to bear wittnes of the light. Io.</hi> 1.7.8. And yet all theſe conſequences be as Good as this your conſequence: <hi>Chriſt biddeth vs ſearch the Scriptures, therefore wee muſt attend to them alone, and take them alone to be of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient authority to ground faith in all points neceſsary; and not attend to the Church.</hi> I will give you a conſequence, though moſt bad, yet to the full as good as this: <hi>S.

If wee read (as wee may) <hi>you do ſearch;</hi> then this place evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the ſearch of the Scriptures only doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Salvation: and therefore it is as probable (to the very full) that this text maketh againſt you, as that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for you. And this interpretation of mine is not only the interpretation of <hi>S.

Again, the knowledge of the only Rule of faith is neceſſary for all: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not bidd all common people <hi>ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> for at that time the Scriptures were not in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riake Language at all; which only Language the people of the Iewes <hi>could vnderſtand.

Much more is it true of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpeeches made to vs in Scripture <hi>for our Salvation,</hi> and able to bring vs effectually to it, if wee follow them, eſpecially ſuch ſpeeches as bidde vs ſo often to follow the Church. See the many places I cited <hi>S.</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 1. Theſe Scriptures then ſo full of theſe ſpeeches, and theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine writings then ſo full of theſe ſpeeches, and theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine writings expounded, not by private, but by publike expoſition of the Church, <hi>do not in part only and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,

work this effect, by teaching vs ſome knowledges to that effect;</hi> but they teach vs a great ſumme of ſuch knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as are able to effect the worke, though not by giuing vs every particular point to be done, but by telling vs whence every particular point might ſecurely be had. Yet to give you fuller ſatisfaction; I ſay, it was farre from <hi>S. Pauls</hi> mind to ſay the Scriptures <hi>are able to make vs wiſe to Salvation,</hi> as they are vſed by thoſe, who take them as interpreted according to that ſenſe, that every man ſhall in his Conſcience iudge to be true. The Scripture thus taken, breedeth infinite inconveniences, as I ſhewed at large <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. whence appeares that the Scriptures vſed ſo, are the cauſe of many mens damnation. <hi>S. Paul</hi> then did not ſpeak of the Scriptures taken ſo (as you do;) but he ſaid, <hi>they were able to make Timothie wiſe to Salvation;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was indeed <hi>a man of God who did continue in the things which he learned and had been aſſured of;</hi> to witt, by the orall tradition of the Doctors of the Church, and by <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelfe: for ſo <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth mee in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his former Chapter ſaying to <hi>Timothie; Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (my Sonne) be ſtrong in the grace, that is in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the things which thou haſt heard of mee among many witneſses.</hi> And in the Chapter before that <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Hould faſt the forme of ſound words which thou haſt heard of mee.</hi> Yea and in this third Chapter, <hi>But thou haſt fully known my doctrine, Manner of life</hi> &amp;c. All this doctrine he could, not have known by any Scripture, of which a ſmal part was then written. Give mee then a Timothy, a man ſo well prein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Tradition, ſo faſt a houlder of Traditions, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a man ſo knowing from whome he had learned theſe things; and I will freely allow you, that the <hi>Scriptures will make ſuch a man wiſe to Salvation:</hi> For he will be ſure to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62436:91"/>
take them, not vpon any priuate mans iudgment, or vpon his own; but to take them as interpreted by the Church, whom he will be ſure never to contradict; ſhee beeing the pillar and Ground of Truth, as that his great Maiſter ſaith, <hi>all whoſe Doctrine</hi> he fully knew. But thoſe Scriptures which <hi>are able to make ſuch a man of God,</hi> ſuch a Timothie, <hi>wiſe to Salvation, and throughly furnished or perfected to every good work,</hi> are not able to do this effect, if vſed in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contrary to that which I have ſhewed they were vſed by him, and ſhould be vſed by vs. Wee do abuſe them if wee take them and diſcanon them (as I may ſay) by our private interpretations, contrary to the Tradition, and vnanimous expoſition of the Church. Theſe men vſe Scriptures <hi>to theyr perdition</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaid ſome did the hard places of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Epiſtles: Whence you ſee that misinterpretations <hi>of hard places</hi> were made <hi>to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Interpreters. Wonder not then to hear vs ſay that the obſcurity of ſome places of Scripture have occaſioned the perdition of the falſe interpreters of thoſe places, out of which ſtate of perdition ſome guide there muſt be who can leade them ſecurely: Can you find mee a ſurer then the Church? There is no want of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Scripture but there is great abundance of fallibility in our private iudgment of diſcretion, which maketh vs need a ſure guide in the interpretation thereof.</p>

Here alſo I muſt tell you how <hi>M. Fisher</hi> did excellently ſilence <hi>D. White,</hi> when in theyr publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he vrged, this text, <hi>The Scripture is profitable:</hi> &amp;c. For, ſayd he, <hi>Although wood be profitable to make the ſubſtance of a houſe, to make waineſcot, ſtooles, tables, and other furniture; yet hence doth not follow wood alone is ſufficient to build and furnish a houſe: So Scripture is profitable for all theſe ends, but alone it is not ſufficient.</hi> Whence all the weight of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument comes to this; that if it be ſo profitable as to make a man wiſe to Salvation, it muſt be ſufficient by it ſelfe alone to do ſo: which I have already ſhewed to be falſe; without you take the whole Canon of Scripture as interpreted by the Holy Church, or as vnderſtood by thoſe who are preinſtructed by Traditions, as <hi>Timothie</hi> was.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Indeed you ſay, <hi>this ſufficiency belongs to the whole Scripture, though in proportion only to every book;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62436:92"/>
the Apoſtle ſayd, <hi>That Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe to Salvation.</hi> How they are able to do this, I have ſhewed; But M. Doctor of what Scriptures did <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſay theſe words? If he did not ſay theſe words of the whole Canon of the Scriptures which wee now have, and to which you ſtreach theſe words; this place cannot poſſibly prove that this ſufficiency belongs to the whole Scriptures wee now have: But it is evident he did not ſpeake theſe words of the whole Canon of the Scripture which wee now have; for almoſt all the new Scripture was as then not written. How could that, which was not at all, haue a beeing then able to make <hi>Timothie</hi> wiſe to Salvation? <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpoke of the ſufficiency (if you pleaſe) of all Scriptures which were then extant. You deny this ſufficiency to them, and you ſay: <hi>It belongs to the whole Scripture, though in proportion to every booke:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it belonged in proportion only to thoſe bookes which were written then. Why did <hi>S. Paul</hi> then ſay of thoſe bookes then extant, that they were able to make a man wiſe to Salvation? Now anſwer your own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Again; if every Book of Scripture contributeth its proportionable part, to make vp a whole body of Bookes compleatly ſufficient to this purpoſe; how will you do now, when no fewer then twenty Bookes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are quite loſt, as I have ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 7. Wee have not any thing like a Text, by which wee can prove that theſe 20. Bookes were not as requiſite to make vp this full ſufficiency of the whole Canon, to decide all Controverſies, as any other twenty which wee have; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if you except the four Ghoſpels. And yet the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of one of theſe Ghoſpels is alſo quite loſt; and wee have no ſurer ground for that beleefe, by which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62436:93"/>
wee beleeve our ſelves to have the true Coppy of it, then the Tradition of the Church: if ſhee be fallible in her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wee cannot beleeve any thing in S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Ghoſpel: as I ſhewed <hi>ſect.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whereas you object that, <hi>though the Scripture did conteyne more things plainly in it ſelfe, and shew vs from whence wee may have the reſt, that is from the Church: Yet thus the Scripture could not be ſayd to make vs perfect, for ſo the Law might be ſaid to make vs perfect, becauſe it sheweth vs Chriſt, and was a Schoolmaſter to him. Gal:</hi> 3. <hi>And</hi> Iohn Baptiſt <hi>might have been ſaid to have perfected his Diſciples by shewing them Chriſt.</hi> So you. I anſwer, that you all fight againſt this objection with every text you bring in this controverſy againſt vs: For as the two former, So all the following texts objected againſt vs, ſpeake of the ould Teſtament, or Law; for <hi>In that (Chriſt</hi> ſaid) <hi>the Iewes thought to find Salvation;</hi> of that he ſaid, <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> of that <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was able to make a man wiſe to Salvation, it was profitable, ſo that by it the man of God is throughly furnished or perfected</hi> (mark that word) to <hi>every good work.</hi> And now behould you your ſelfe come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre for an abſurdity, that the ould Scripture ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do this. Wee freely acknowledge that the Law of it ſelfe could perfect no man, no nor juſtify any man, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly ſayth in the place cited: but they were all to be juſtified by faith in Chriſt. The Law, as introducing to this, did ſufficiently perfect all thoſe, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnder the Law: independently of this, it did not do ſo. As for S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> you are clearly tould by <hi>S. Luke C.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 13. that he was ſent <hi>Parare Domino plebem perfectam, to prepare to our Lord a perfect people:</hi> and towards the end of that Chapter, <hi>Thou Child shalt be called the Prophet of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62436:93"/>
higheſt: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare for his wayes, to give knowledge of Salvation vnto his people by the remiſsion of theyr Sinnes.</hi> Can you ſhew the Scripture doth more in this point then it ſayth <hi>S. Iohn</hi> did?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Your third text is, <hi>You shall not adde to the word which I ſpeak vnto you, nor take from it.</hi> Deut: 4.2. Therefore the Scripture is ſo perfect, and ſo ſufficient, that it alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynes all neceſſaries; <hi>and therefore condemns the ſuperadded Traditions.</hi> You have forgot <hi>M. Doctor</hi> your very <hi>laſt words; That the</hi> Law (cheifly conteyned in Deutronomy) <hi>could not make vs perfect:</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d now you bring theſe words as words implying the perfection and ſufficiency of it; For of it alone theſe words are ſpoken. <hi>Secondly you</hi> have forgot your very firſt words of this your 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> where you putt three ſorts of Tradition that you allow there, and §. 13. Bee not theſe additions to the written word? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have forgot that the Iewes had at leaſt two vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable Traditions, beſides thoſe which delivered the Scriptures and the true ſenſe of the Scriptures vnto them: For they knew only by tradition <hi>what remedy was to be vſed to free theyr female-Children from originall Sinne;</hi> as alſo <hi>to free theyr male-Children in danger of death before the eight day.</hi> This remedy they knew and obſerved, and were bound to know and obſerve. And yet they infallibly knew it without haueing any Scripture expreſſing to them the knowledge of this remedy, or of theyr obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vſe it, Or that it was ſo neceſſary for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of theyr Children, whom they did beleeve to be in Originall Sinne, and by that debarred from Salvation, vnles ſome remedy were applied. Some remedy ſurely was as neceſſary for the female, as Circumciſion for the male: Shew mee this Remedy in Scripture. <hi>Secondly</hi> they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62436:94"/>
truly beleeved ſome of thoſe bloudy Sacrifices to have been appointed vnto them by God, for the expiation of theyr Sinnes; but they could not truly beleeve that any of thoſe Sacrifices could expiate theyr Sinnes by its own vertue: They beleeved then that thoſe Sacrifices had this expiative vertue from the merits of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſhew mee any text in which this was then written. It is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſay that this faith was not neceſſary to that Church, at leaſt ſo as to be beleeved by ſome among them. <hi>Fourthly, M. Doctor,</hi> you forget againſt whom you bring this teſtimony: If it belongs only to the Iewes; why do you bring it againſt Chriſtians? If it belongs alſo to Chriſtians; why do you not circumciſe your ſelves? You vrge againſt vs, <hi>Ye shall not adde:</hi> Wee vrge againſt you, <hi>ye shall not diminish. Fiftly M. Doctor</hi> you forget that you are to conclude thus; <hi>The whole Canon of Scripture is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient direction for vs:</hi> and you conclude, that the <hi>Law of Moſes is a ſufficient direction for vs;</hi> which you and yours confeſſe to be falſe. <hi>Sixtly</hi> you forget that a whole ſcore of bookes are diminiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Canon by beeing quite loſt; halfe a ſcore more you will take from vs, and caſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Apocrypha. Do you think that no part of this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is wanting to ſuch a Canon as you now have! Give mee your text for that. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> you forget that it is impoſſible for you to prove, that the Scriptures muſt be taken either as they ſound, or taken by every man in that ſenſe that he in his own Conſcience iudgeth. Give vs the Scriptures taken in the ſenſe which the viſible Church iudgeth (for the Iudge of the ſenſe muſt be viſible;) and wee will graunt all. For then without any addition, and by only true interpretation, wee will prove that wee muſt take the Church for our infallible guide: and ſhee will
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62436:94"/>
ſhew vs Scripture rightly by her interpreted, for the admitting of vnwritten Tradition. In the midle of this your ſeavenfold forgetfulnes I pray remember what pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull texts you have putt in the forefront to prove that, which, if not proved better, your Religion will prove moſt pittifully grounded. The ſenſe of the words which you vrge is litterally this; Let no man preſume by his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interpretations to deprave any Law either by reſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yning, or ſtreaching the natural ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the words in which it is delivered. For example; God in the 17. of Deutronomy <hi>v.</hi> 11.12. ſayth; <hi>Thou shalt not decline from the Sentence which they</hi> (that is the High Prieſts) <hi>shall shew thee, to the right hand nor to the left. And the man that will do preſumptuouſly, and will not harken vnto the Prieſt, even that man shall dye.</hi> God would not have this Law depraved by ſuch an interpretation as you vſe to give; that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is to be followed of thoſe Iudges which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to tell you what was Gods Law rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if they give ſentence according to Scripture; as you would have it expounded.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Your fourth text</hi> out of the end of the Revelations is incomparably weaker, and it evidently damneth your Father <hi>Luther</hi> and Lutheran Bretheren vnto Hell; for S. <hi>Iohn teſtifyeth to every man that heareth the words of the propheſie of this Booke</hi> (he ſpeakes of the <hi>Revelations</hi> only:) <hi>If any man shall adde vnto theſe things, God shall adde vnto him the plagues which are written in this Book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the Book of this propheſie, God shall take his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy Citie.</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> took away <hi>all the words of the Book of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> when he ſaid in his firſt Preface to the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that he received this book neither for Propheticall nor
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62436:95"/>
Apoſtolicall:</hi> Therefore <hi>God shall take his part out of the book of life, and out of the Holy Citie.</hi> The ſame ſhall be done to his Lutheran diſciples. Thus you ſee I have concluded evidently what I ſaid, let vs hear you conclude; <hi>Nothing muſt be added to this book; therefore all the Scripture is ſufficient to decide all controverſies;</hi> though twenty whole bookes of it be loſt, and though you take all the texts of the whole Canon in that ſenſe which every man in his conſcience thinketh beſt: Thus in effect you conclude. Note alſo that there is no kind of certaintie that the Apocalyps was the laſt book of Scripture; for your own <hi>Kemnitius</hi> houlds S. <hi>Iohn</hi> his Goſpel written after that; and moſt hould his Epiſtles the very laſt part of Scripture. Now marke, that the very laſt verſes, which were written in his laſt Epiſtle are. <hi>I had many things to write</hi> (now when all the Scripture was written:) <hi>But I will not with inke and pen write vnto thee.

Doctor you forget that, in the beginning and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of your booke, you will have our Church to be one and the ſame with yours in ſuch fundamentals as conſtitute a Church: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d will you now prove this Church,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62436:95"/>
by the ſentence of the Apoſtle to have been accurſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematized, and excommunicated, or cut off from the true Church? You muſt ſweat to find God a true Church vpon Earth, if ours ſtood excommunicated by S. <hi>Paul</hi> ever ſince it held Traditions. Secondly you forget that you bring this Curſe vpon your own head, for it is you who preach an other Goſpel from that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and that which wee received from him, <hi>To ſtand faſt and hould the Traditions which wee have learned whether by word or Epiſtle.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15. And ſure wee are that the Epiſtles to the Theſſallonians did not conteyne the whole Goſpel: If they did, then find in thoſe Epiſtles, that you muſt take the Scripture only for your Rule in all points of faith, and all other neceſſary points. It is alſo the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul; The things which thou haſt heard of mee before many witneſses, the ſame commend thou vnto faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, which shall be fitt to teach others alſo.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim:</hi> 2.2. You will have vs commend to other men, not thoſe things which were only <hi>heard before many Witneſſes</hi> by publicke Tradition, but only ſuch as are written: You therefore gainſay <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and on you the Curſe of his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication falleth. Where you ſee, by the way, a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why wee could not hould you in our Communion, you beeing anathematized by <hi>S. Paul</hi> himſelfe. Wee then, conformably to the doctrine of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſay that the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which he preached vnto them, and the Ghoſpel which they had received (ſee his firſt Epiſtle to them <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. &amp; 2.) was a Ghoſpel, which is moſt truely expounded by vs to conteyne both his vnwritten and written doctrine: Yet in all probability very litle of the Ghoſpel had been, as then, delivered in writing vnto the Galatians; or tell mee how much, if you can? Sure I am that, beſides what was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62436:96"/>
written, they were yet to receive much more in writing: Yea the ſureſt opinion is, that the firſt thing that ever <hi>S. Paul</hi> did write was the very Epiſtle to the Galatians, as is well proved by the Remiſh Teſtament in the Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Epiſtle to the Romans. And you can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things but coniectures to affirme that he had delivered at this time any written Ghoſpel at all vnto them. Again you moſt vnskilfully ſay, <hi>that this text muſt be meant of the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ghoſpel only, for that which is written beareth</hi> (you meane, only) <hi>the name of Ghoſpel.</hi> for firſt this very place proueth the contrary: Secondly many other places ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for in <hi>S. Mathew</hi> c. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Ieſus went about all Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee preaching the Ghoſpel:</hi> what Ghoſpel was then written? And <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Ieſus went about all the Cittes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Villages prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Ghoſpel:</hi> what Ghoſpel was then written? or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when our Saviour ſayd; <hi>whereſoever this Ghoſpel shall be preached. c.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>S. Mar: c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Ieſus came into Galilee preaching the Ghoſpel of the kingdome, ſaying repent and beleeve the Ghoſpel.</hi> What written Ghoſpel did they know? or S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom in the 10. Chapter <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaketh about leaving goods <hi>for the Ghoſpel.</hi> And thus, I might runne over the new Teſtament, where the word <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> is ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten taken for the doctrine delivered by word of mouth; and perhaps not thrice in all Scripture it is clearly taken for the written Ghoſpel. And alſo <hi>To Evangelize</hi> is far more frequently taken for preaching the vnwritten word, then the written. This text then moſt convincingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that <hi>S. Paul</hi> commands them by no meanes to go againſt the doctrine <hi>rceeived by Tradition.</hi> As for <hi>S. Auſtens</hi> authority, with which you back your interpretation, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> tould you truely, that he did not expound this text, but did only cite it to proue that nothing was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62436:96"/>
againſt Scripture: No nor beſides Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted truely by the publick authority of the Church; as I ſaid before: And this anſwer ſatisfieth what you bring out of <hi>S. Ierom;</hi> although indeed he ſpeaketh of thoſe who bring not known and publik tradition of the Churh; but of thoſe who deviſe new things and give them out for ould Traditions: which not beeing true Traditions delivered by the Church, muſt needs be of no authority; without they can prove theyr truth by Scripture, which they cannot prove by true Tradition.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is therefore falſe which you ſay, that in the Iudgment of <hi>S. Aug:</hi> and <hi>S. Ierom</hi> it is enough to incurre the Anathema, if they teach any thing of faith beſides that which is receiued from Scripture, in the ſenſe you take this word <hi>Beſides.</hi> It is alſo impoſſible to ſhew that <hi>S. Paul</hi> there ſpoke of Scripture. Yea he ſpeakes of that which they <hi>had received from him,</hi> who neuer writt any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Epiſtle, as I ſaid: neither do wee teach any thing of faith <hi>beſides</hi> that which hath authority from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though not from the Scripture expounded as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men think fitteſt, but from Scripture rightly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded by the Church, to which wee adde nothing but what Scripture bids vs adde. Wherefore the authorities you cite are ill applyed to vs, for wee ſpeake nothing without authority and teſtimony of the Scripture taken in this manner, as it ſhould euer be; neither adde wee any thing what, is not written; For it is written, <hi>Hould ye the Traditions.</hi> If you ſay, this is no true Tradition. I am by Scripture bidden to hear the Church before you. Note that it is a very good argument to ſay, it is nowhere written, therefore it is not to be admitted; if this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be only vſed as the Fathers vſe it, that is, when it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62436:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was notorius that ſuch a thing was not delivered by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For what is not delivered by Church Tradition, muſt be proued by Scripture. See <hi>S.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 6. You ſee what litle need wee haue to interpret the woords, <hi>beſides what I haue preached,</hi> to be the ſame, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what</hi> I preached. Yet becauſe this is very true, it is iuſtified by <hi>Bellarmiue:</hi> and you, not going about to anſwer ſo much as one of the proofes, deſerve no anſwer. Yet marke what what <hi>S.

Auſten (contra Maximum l.</hi> 1.) Bringeth in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Heretike ſpeaking thus to the Catholikes. <hi>If you bring any thing from the Scripture, it is neceſſary that wee hear it: But theſe words which be beſides Scripture, are in no caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of vs, ſeeing our Lord doth admonish vs ſaying, in vain they worship mee teaching the Commandements of men.</hi> So that Heretike. Iuſt ſo you and yours. I anſwer firſt that many things may be commanded by God and yet not written, and ſo be precepts not of men, but of God, though wee be aſſured of them by men. For all precepts which were for thoſe two thouſand yeares and more, concerning worſhip or faith, neceſſary in thoſe Ages to Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Scriptures were written, were truly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and doctrine of God, and as ſuch to be obſerved; though this obligation was notified only by the man of that Church. For example, the fall of Adam, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made our future Redemption, was notified by Adams Children, who delivered the ſame to theyr Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo downwards. So wee read Gen: 9. <hi>That God ſaid to Noe and his Sonnes, that it was</hi> not permitted to them to eat blood <hi>v.</hi> 4. This precept was obliging all the world vpon the credit of the Tradition of ſo few. So li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe wee read in the 17. of Geneſis, that <hi>when Abraham was ninetie yeares ould and nine, the Lord appeared vnto him a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made a Couenant with him and his</hi> ſeed, to make him the Father of the faithfull, to bleſſe all in his ſeed: And then him, and all his poſterity, a moſt ſtrickt precept of Circumciſion. All this Abraham only notified to his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62436:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
poſterity: They all beleeved this promiſe and Covenant of God, and they all ſtrictly obſerved this precept of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: And yet neither this precept, nor this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, were written for thoſe four hundred years a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more which paſſed between the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt Scripture writer. Was that vnwritten Covenant the doctrine of man? Was Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the precept of man? No. Was the precept of not eating blood the precept of man? and yet by Tradition it had all its force, even from <hi>Noë</hi> to <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vntill the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> among the Iewes. Well the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why ſhould the vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and precepts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, be called the doctrine and precepts of men? You can ſay nothing, but that the teſtimony of men is not ſufficient ground for vs to hould this doctrine, and theſe precepts to be divine or Apoſtolicall; whigh is apparently falſe: For the men of the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſupreme Paſtors and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof, cannot be of leſſe credit and authority, then were the men of the Law of Nature, or of the ſeed of Abraham, or the teſtimony of <hi>Noë</hi> and his ſons. Their teſtimony could, and did ſuffice to make their doctrine, and precepts, delivered by God in a farre more private manner, to be notwithſtanding prudently beleeved, and imbraced for divine. Why then ſhould not the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Church ſuffice to make the vnwritten doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles to be held for divine? It is therefore no kind of proofe to ſay; <hi>Chriſt reprehends human doctrines and precepts, therefore wee muſt not imbrace divine doctrines and precepts meerly becauſe they are not written.</hi> You imbrace the doctrine of men, who tell vs this doctrine of yours; which is neyther written nor delivered by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall tradition. Again, were not all the precepts and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62436:99"/>
doctrines of <hi>Chriſt</hi> beleeved as divine for thoſe, fourſcore yeares or there abouts, before the whole Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was finiſhed? of all theſe Traditions ſee my <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 1. 2. and the whole 19. <hi>Sect.</hi> Secondly, I pray how do you auoide the imbracing doctrine of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hould the Churches authority to be meer human: and yet meerly vpon her authority you receive ſuch, and ſuch Copyes to be the true Copyes of the true Originall word of God: ſee <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 3. 4. &amp;c Yea, vpon the meer weak teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your owne private Tranſlatours, all you (who are not exceeding skilfull in Greek) take your Engliſh Bible for the word of God; and againe, vpon the meer weak authority of your Miniſters, you take that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for true which they tell you to be ſo; though you cannot know it to be ſo, for want of skill in Languages, and for want of skill in conferring places, and for want of ability to vſe thoſe twenty Rules which your own Doctors hould neceſſary for the knowing aſſuredly the true ſenſe of God. Thus I might ſhew you how in all thoſe twenty four neceſſary points (which I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhewed not conteyned in any part of the written word of God) you hould truly and properly the doctrine and precepts of men, whom you believe to have meerly human authority. Thus you proceed as the Iewes and Phariſees did, not relying only vpon the traditions they had from Moſes; (for example, concerning the remedy againſt originall Sinne appliable to female Children:) but relying vpon traditions deviſed by ſome ill interpreters of theyr Law; by <hi>Sammai,</hi> by <hi>killel,</hi> by <hi>Achiba</hi> and ſuch other Rabbins: as <hi>S. Ierom</hi> teacheth in Severall places.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Whereas you adde, that our Traditions are to be chalenged of contrariety to the Scripture for the moſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62436:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
part, you proceed in your vſuall manner to ſay bouldy what is for your turne, but never turne your hand or fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to prove it. <hi>M. Doctor,</hi> I will vndertake to make good at any time, that there is incomparable more difficultie to ſhew that one part of the written word is not contrary to ſome other, then to ſhew that any one of our Traditions be farre from the leaſt contrariety to the word of God: ſee <hi>Sect.</hi> 23 <hi>n:</hi> 6. All Schollers know I ſpeak in this point that which is evident. Thus I have anſwered your whole 23. Section.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. I have now a word of great importance to ſay to you and yours. You affirme the Scripture alone to be neceſſarily admitted by vs, as our ſole and only iudge. In this, your part is affirmative, and ſo you muſt prove what you ſay. In this you contradict all viſible Catholik Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were in the world at your Reformation: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo publik authority evidence of Scripture muſt be brought; or elſe you do moſt iniuriouſly oppoſe ſo publik an Authority, according to your own principles. Thirdly in this you deliver a point which (is true) is no leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then the true choice of the only Rule directing to true faith; Therefore, according to your own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples this point muſt be clearly conteyned to Sripture, in which you ſay all neceſſary points are clearly contayned. But wee have now at large heard every next you thought fitt to bring for a thing of ſo great concernment; The anſwers given to every one ſhew clearly, not any one of them to conteyne that point clearly: Whence I conclude, that what in ſuch kind of matters, cannot be proved by clear texts, muſt not be beleeved, according to your own principles; therefore, even according to them, wee are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

only Rule of faith, or that it clearly conteynes the plain deciſion of all neceſſary controverſies; which it muſt <hi>do</hi> to be our Iudge in them <hi>all.</hi> Remember <hi>M.

                  <p n="2">2. What importeth more a dying Chriſtian, then to have his Sinne, forgiven him; and that vpon the word of God? and yet you cry <hi>Superſtition, Superſtition, if a Prieſt be called to fray over him, and to anoint bim with oyle, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure forgivenes of his Sinnes.</hi> But what faith your own Bible? <hi>Is any Man ſicke among you, let him call for the Elders</hi> (the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts) <hi>of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyle in the name of the Lord, and the payer of the faithfull shall ſave the ſick. And the Lord shall rayſe him vp, and if he hath committed Sinnes they shall be forgiven him.</hi> Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes 5.14.

to be a Sacrament, or viſible ſigne (ſuch an one as the act of anointing is) of inviſible grace conferred thereby to forgive his Sinnes, for (ſayth the text) <hi>if he be in Sinnes, they shall be forgiven him.</hi> If your haue but any one text halfe ſo clear for that prime fundamentall point of yours, I pray bring if forth now whileſt that and the anſwer to that is in freſh memory, That anſwer will tell you what I have to ſay againſt any ſuch text: Let vs ſee what you can ſay againſt this text? ſome anſwer, that it relateth to the guift of healing in thoſe dayes; which ſhift it directly againſt the words of the text ſaying, <hi>if he hath committed Sins, they shall be forgiven.</hi> Againe what Scripture have; you to prove that the elders in the days of <hi>S.

Laſtly I am moſt earneſt to know by what clearer text then this, you were forced to forſake the practice of this Sacrament vſed by all Catholike Churches vpon earth, when you caſt it off as Superſtitious; Where is, I pray, your ſo much boaſted-of evidence of Scripture againſt ſo publik Authority? M. Doctor remember your own words cited in the end of my laſt Section. Remember that you §. 43. ſay that <hi>the vniverſall practice of the Church is the beſt Interpreter of Scripture, if here there is no plain Text</hi> (as here there is not) <hi>to take away all gainſaying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When a litle after your firſt Reformation you (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Churches both of Eaſt and weſt) denyed the Real Preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Sacrament; by what clearer text could you evidently demonſtrate that thoſe following texts could not be truely interpreted of a reall preſence? <hi>This is my Body: The bread which I will give is my flesh; my flesh is meat indeed, my blood is drink indeed:</hi> in ſo much as <hi>he who eateth or drinketh vnworthily is guilty of the

                  <p n="4">4. Again, when you denied the prieſts of the Church to have power to forgive Sinnes, contradicting alſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the Catholike Churches vpon the earth; what clearer text did you bring againſt them all, to prove that they falſely interpreted to theyr purpoſe this text: <hi>He brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vpon them, and ſaid, whoſe Sinnes ſo ever yee shall remitt, they are remitted: and whoſe Sinnes ſo ever yee shall retayne they are reteyned Io.</hi> 20.22.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Holy Fathers never allowed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the only Rule of faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is moſt vnreaſonable to ſay, that the greateſt Doctors of the primitive Church did not know the only Rule of faith: For this point importing above all point, the Apoſtles muſt needs (had it been ſo) have imprinted it deepely in the minds of all they inſtructed; and all theyr Diſciples would have done the like to theyr Diſciples: ſo that many of the Church, eſpecially the moſt learned of the whole Church, would not be ignorant of this point; at leaſt I am ſure, that you may ſooner now be preſumed ignorant of the only true Rule of faith; then they then.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Firſt then, had the Holy Fathers ever allowed of the Scripture for the only Rule of faith, they neither would, nor could have held any men Heretikes for hould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which was contrary to no clear Scripture: but they did hould many ſuch to be Heretikes, as I have ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 8. where I ſhewed that <hi>S. Auſten</hi> did hould on the one ſide, that Baptiſme of Children could not be proved by cleare, Scripture; and yet he, in and with the Milevetan Councel condemned thoſe for heretikes who did deny the neceſſity of Baptiſme for Children. See <hi>Sect:</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:62436:103"/>
8. <hi>n:</hi> 3. 4. 5. There alſo <hi>n:</hi> 6. He and <hi>Vicentius Lerinenſis</hi> accovnteth them heretikes who held rebaptization ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all baptized by heretikes: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet he held on the other ſide, that this point could not be cleared out of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; ſee them <hi>n:</hi> 7. In the next number I did ſhew how Antiquity hold alſo the Quarta-decimani for hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, though the beleeving Eaſter ought to be alwayes kept on the fourteenth day of the Moone be not againſt clear Scripture. There alſo I ſhewed out of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and alſo <hi>S. Auſten</hi> (who expreſly in the beginning of his Catalogue profeſſeth to put down none but ſuch as are true heretiks) that <hi>Aërius</hi> was held by antiquity for an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, <hi>becauſe he denyed prayer for the dead, and held that there was no faſting dayes of precept:</hi> in which points I am ſure you will ſay that this <hi>Aërius</hi> held nothing contrary to Scripture. There alſo I ſhewed out of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> that the <hi>Antidicomarites or Helvidians</hi> were held he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes by Antiquity, for denying that our Lady after the birth of our Saviour did ever live a Virgin: which point is not clear in Scripture. Therefore all thoſe were heretikes, not for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicting Scripture; yet they were heretikes for contradicting ſome Rule of faith: therefore there is ſome other Rule of faith beſides Scripture; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture alone is not the only Rule of faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Secondly it was by holy Fathers noted to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to heretikes to ſtand to Scripture only, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all other Rules: <hi>So the Macedonians and Eunomians, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no regard of what was taught to the contrary by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and antiquity of Chriſtians, denyed the Holy Ghoſt to be glorified with the Father and the Sonne; becauſe the Scripture did no where expreſſely ſay this. S. Baſil de Sp: Sanc: c.</hi> 25. and <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Eunom:</hi> So the Pelagians (in <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten de Natura &amp; gratia c.</hi> 39.) were vſed to ſay; <hi>Let vs
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62436:103"/>
beleeve that which wee read, but let vs beleeve it to be a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes to beleeve that which wee do not read.</hi> So S. <hi>Auſten L.</hi> 1. againſt <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Arian Biſhop, bringeth him in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>If thou bring forth any thing from thoſe divine Scriptures which are common to vs both, wee muſt needs heare thee. But thoſe ſpeeches which are not in Scripture, be, by no meanes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved by vs, ſeeing that our Lord admonisheth vs and ſayth, without cauſe they worshippe mee teaching the Commandements and precepts of men.</hi> So he. And juſt ſo you, as is clear by your objection in the laſt Section but one before this, <hi>Num.</hi> 13. and again <hi>I wish to be the Diſciple of divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvres.</hi> Wherefore the Councel of Sens in the ſeventh age decreed (<hi>Decreto</hi> 5.) <hi>That it was a dangerous thing to be in that error, that nothing is to be admitted which is not drawn from Scripture. For many things are derived by</hi> Chriſt <hi>from the hands of the Apoſtles from mouth to mouth &amp;c. which are to be houlden without all doubt.</hi> See <hi>Sect:</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thirdly the Holy Fathers expreſly refuſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute out of Scriptures only, vpon this very cauſe, that they do not ſuffice to end and decide all controverſies. So the moſt ancient <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh firſt in generall of never diſputing with heretikes. <hi>C.</hi> 17. Out of Scriptures only, <hi>Becauſe this Scripture-combat availeth to nothing; but to the makeing either ones ſtomake, or ones brains to turne. lib. de Praeſ. C.</hi> 17. And by and by he in particular ſayth of the Gnoſtikes, that which wee may ſay of our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>This hereſy doth not receive ſome Scriptures;</hi> (you put ten bookes among the Apocripha) <hi>ſome Scriptures they receive with additions a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d detractions ordered to theyr turne:</hi> (ſee what I ſaid of your tranſlations <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>and thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they receive in any manner intierly, they turne to theyr turne by new deviſed expoſitions</hi> (ſee how you do this <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62436:104"/>
Then he concludes generally: <hi>wee muſt not therefore appeal to ſcriptures, nor in our combat rely vpon them, in which either no victory is to be obteyned, or a very Vncertain one.</hi> Which how true it is, you may ſee in my Scripture-diſputation about the keeping of Sunday, <hi>Sect:</hi> 9. where I gave you text for text, as good as you brought or could bring. Thus the Anabaptiſts do not only weary you out, and ſhew you to the very eye; that, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to Scripture alone, they are invincible by you: but alſo they ſome times force your prime Doctors to leave theyr ſtanding on Scripture only, and force them to fly to Tradition. See <hi>D. Taylors</hi> plain confeſſion hereof <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 4. And your great <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> found this inſiſting vpon Scripture only to breed ſuch endles iarring that in his laſt book but one, <hi>he profeſseth himſelfe to be weary of ſuch combates and encounters, becauſe he findeth controverſies thereby made brawles; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wishes that in ſome Common aſſembly of Churches all theſe ſtriffes at once were decided.</hi> The evidence of this point made your learned <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> in his review P. 42. to ſay, <hi>it is falſe that wee will admitt of no Iudge but Scripture; for wee appeal ſtill to a lawfull generall Councel.</hi> But there I would ask, how wee can reſt vpon the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giuen by a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, if that be not infallible; for ſtill every man muſt be calling this Sentence to review made by his own weak iudgement: as hath been fully declared <hi>Sect.</hi> i. <hi>n:</hi> 1. 2 3. 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Some of our adverſaries think to ſhift off the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as if it were delivered againſt thoſe only who reiected great part of the Scriptures, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted other parts; which, ſay they, wee do not. I anſwer, that of your like proceedings I have ſpoken enough in the places I cited ioyntly with Tertullians words: But this your ſhift is clearly vndone by Tertullians own words
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62436:104"/>
following, <hi>C.</hi> 45. <hi>Wee now hitherto have in generall</hi> (mark this word) <hi>treated againſt all hereſies, repelling them</hi> (all) <hi>vpon certain iuſt and neceſſary exceptions from Conferring out of Scriptures.</hi> So he. Yea the very drift of a great part of this his litle book is, independently of all Scripture, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all heretikes, by proving that true beleevers muſt be able to ſhew by tradition the deſcent of theyr doctrine from the Apoſtles. <hi>But if indeed truth ſtands for vs</hi> (ſayth he, <hi>C.</hi> 37.) <hi>who ſoever wee be who walk in that Rule which the Church hath received from Chriſt, Chriſt from God, wee proceed manifeſtly in our intent, defining that heretikes ought not to be admitted to make theyr appeale to Scriptures whom we do prove without the Scriptures, not to have any right to the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> Note heere firſt, that he ſpeakes of ſuch <hi>as would appeal to Scriptures;</hi> therefore they did receive them, Note Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>that without Scriptures Tertullian</hi> promiſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſureſt Victory, by forceing them to ſhew theyr viſible ſucceſſion, and to ſhew theyr doctrine delivered from hand to hand by Tradition or word of Mouth; as that word was <hi>which the Apoſtles received from Chriſt, and Chriſt from God.</hi> By <hi>this Rule he</hi> would have, vs <hi>all walke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our adverſaries vſe to alledge ſome paſſages of Fathers appealing in theyr diſputes againſt heretikes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures, cheefly <hi>S. Auſten</hi> who diſputing againſt the Donatiſts conceived himſelfe to have moſt manifeſt texts to prove againſt them that <hi>Chriſt</hi> true Church could never grow ſo low, as to be viſible only in part of Africa; the viſibility of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Church through the world beeing manifeſt in Scripture, as he ſaith <hi>de vnitate Eccleſiae, C.</hi> 7. 11. 15. &amp; 17. But it is no good argument to ſay, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers appealed to the Scriptures in ſome few points, in which they knew they had manifeſt adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tages; therefore
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62436:105"/>
they approved appealing to Scripture only in any kind of controverſy: So it is no argument to ſay; the Fathers did exact written texts of Scripture in proofe of ſome hereticall Novelties; and profeſſed they would not give eare to ſuch Novelties without written texts: therefore wee muſt not admitte of any, though never ſo ancient, beleefe of the whole Church, delivered by Tradition from the Apoſtles, without ſome clear written text can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for it. This is no conſequence; for in points which are knowne not to be delivered by Tradition, yea not ſo much as pretending to it, is a good argument to ſay; Give mee a clear text for this, or elſe with the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility that you affirme it, I will deny it: as I ſayd <hi>S.</hi> 10. <hi>n:</hi> 9. 10. Do but note what I ſaid there, and then ioyn it to theſe places; and all places alleageable out of the Fathers will eaſely be ſolved.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All thoſe Fathers which might he alledged (and part of them is alledged <hi>Sec:</hi> 8.) for houlding Traditions in points neceſſary to Salvation, no where expreſſed in Scripture; as alſo all thoſe who hould the Authority of the Church by it ſelfe to ſuffice to ground our faith, and to determin all our Controverſies (whom wee ſhall cite <hi>Sect:</hi> 21.) all theſe I ſay, clearly hould that Scripture is not the only Rule, guide and direction of all that is neceſſary to be beleeved, or done by vs for obteyning Salvation.</p>

Church) to paſſe to that particular inquiry, whether this Church be the Roman or no, (of which afterward:) yet becauſe this prime objection may be beſt ſolved in this place; I anſwer, that neither <hi>D.

Had Hell gates privailed againſt all ſuch Churches, where (I pray) had there vpon Earth bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> found any one ſingle Church againſt which Church, Hell had not more prevailed, then againſt the Roman? Name but one, and I am ſatisfied.

That Church muſt have theſe and ſuch other qualities, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Scripture in my precedent Section. Knowing you could not finde any Church vpon Earth ſo qualified but the Roman, which taken (as wee vſually take it) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the Churches of all Nations joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vnto her, you are forced ſo to qualify your cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her errors preuailing in her, that you ſay, <hi>they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed not to a totall infection of the members of it, with all the errors and ſuperſtitions that prevailed in it.</hi> How come you to know this; if it be not vpon record, that ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

quantity of men in All Ages (ſufficient to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch a Church, as wee have ſeen <hi>Chriſts</hi> true Church muſt be) did not aſſent to all that was defined by the Roman Church, nor to other errors as great as hers, but kept themſelves to that which you call the pure doctrine <hi>of Chriſt:</hi> if this be not vpon record (as I was ſaying) then you ſay you know not what: If it be vpon record, begin to tell mee who theſe men were in that ſecond, third, fourth, fifth, ſixt age after Popery, againſt whom theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours prevailed not; and I will trouble you with no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther examination of your Records. You can as well eat a whole Milſtone to breakfaſt, as prove any ſuch thing by any Records.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But you ſay the Fathers interpreted this promiſſe, of the gates of Hell not preuailing againſt the Church, of the not failing of the Church; and never of the not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it. Thoſe who object this, mark not that <hi>the cheif way of</hi> failing is to faile by erring. How did the Church faile in the Dominions of the Arians, was it not by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? And ſo of all dominions corrupted by Hereſy. So alſo the whole viſible Church had failed, if the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church had propoſed any errour to be believed for a point of faith; for to do this is to propoſe alye as vpheld by divine authority; which is to fall no leſſe foully then he ſhould fall who ſhould teach, God to be an affirmer and confirmer of Lyes. For whatſoever point any Church held as a point of theyr faith, they held it as a divine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, affirmed and revealed by God: Therefore if in any age the viſible Church held any Errour for a point of faith, it did faile moſt miſerably; And yet your Proteſtant Doctors generally teach, that the only viſible Church did teach ſeverall errors as points of faith. So. <hi>D. Fern</hi> accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62436:116"/>
even the primitive Church of teaching the Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beliefe, and Infants Communion, though moſt falſely; as our Doctors often have ſhewed: Thus they throw dirt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Chriſts</hi> vnſpotted ſpouſe. And as the black Aethiopia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s painted theyr Gods black: So your fouly erroneous Church would have all Churches to have been fouly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; as you would have even the pureſt Church to have been, had ſhee propoſed theſe two groſſe errors for divine verities, as you ſay ſhe did.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Yet to make a ſhew of ſome thing like a Church, <hi>D. Fern</hi> ſayth; <hi>the Gates of Hell may prevaile, not to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall Sauing faith; but to Superſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hay, ſtuble and worſe, I mean errors in beleefe and practiſe; Yet ſuch as may ſtill be convinced by the doctrine of ſauing faith, ſtill preſerved in the Church.</hi> With theſe ſuperſtructions you charge the Roman Church, yet adding; <hi>that shee hath the fundamentall faith in expreſse tearmes delivered down in her, and ſuch ſaving knowledge as was ſufficient to diſcerne the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from the ſuperſtructures.</hi> All this is confidently ſayd by you; but ſtill (like your ſelfe) you end the matter, and offer no kind of proofe: Neyther do you adde any one ſyllable to ſatisfy the great difficulties which occure in this confident aſſertion, againſt which I have ſome thing to ſay. Firſt, to aſſume ſuch Liberty to our privat ſelves, of Limiting that which the Holy Ghoſt thought not fitt to limit; is to teach others to limit ſuch texts as promiſe divine aſſiſtance to Scripture writers, and to the Apoſtles, ſo, as to ſay in like manner, that they ſhall deliver nothing againſt the fundamentall ſauing faith, but yet that they may ſuperadde a vaſt multitude of theyr owne private phanſies. <hi>Secondly</hi> you cannot name a perpetuall viſible true Church, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had vpon Earth, againſt which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62436:117"/>
this Error (for ſo you call it) did not preuaile, of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for an infallible truth whatſoever was propoſed by the Church. Of this error (if it be one) you can aſſigne no beginning in the Roman Church, (nor in any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church:) But this error is a fundamentall error, not only becauſe it layeth the foundation, vpon which infinite errors muſt be built; but cheefly, becauſe it admits of no other ground vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which to fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any divine faith; For it admits of Scripture it ſelfe vpon this only ground, See <hi>Sect:</hi> 20. <hi>n.</hi> 5. If this ground be an Error, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the faith that is in the Roman Church is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and an Error fundamentall, as properly as you can proue any error to be fundamentall: For it makes the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of all our faith to be an error. Have you as good ground to ſay (as you do <hi>Sect:</hi> 6.) The Arian Hereſy is an error directly fundamentall? Wherefore you muſt needs ſay that the gates of Hell prevailed againſt the Roman Church to the Overthrow of fundamentall ſaving faith. And then you will never be able to finde <hi>Chriſt</hi> a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, by which you received your doctrin, your Miſſion, your Ordination, your Succeſſion from the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: for theſe you had not from the Greek Church. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as I iuſt now vrged, every Church, to which you dare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the name of Catholike to have agreed, did teach all the Articles ſhee propoſed to be beleeved as divine veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties revealed by God: even the Greek Church did this. But now, as it is damnable, even in matters of ſmaleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to affirme with an Oath any Lye (becauſe wee ſhould take God for a witnes and aſſertor of our Lye;) ſo it is a moſt damnable thing to all thoſe Churches, to propoſe errours even in matters of ſmaleſt importance for Articles of theyr faith, to be beleeved as divine veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62436:117"/>

In hearing and obeying the Church wee follow Gods Command: But no kind of Errour Litle or great can be incurred by following Gods Command; Therefore in hearing and obeying the Church wee can be led into no kind of Errour litle or great.</p>

Others reply that this text is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, not of hearing this Church in matters of Faith and vnbeleefe, but of matters of trespaſſe between Brother a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d brother, which treſpaſſes are alſo to be tould to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſeverall Prelates; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce maketh nothing for the authority of the vniverſall Church.

in a generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel for every private ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s treſpaſſes. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular private men are to be condemned by they particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prelates of theyr particular Churches, proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known decrees and Orders of the vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church. If any man, when they proceed thus, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth them, he in them diſobeyeth the vniverſall Church; according to whoſe knowne Lawes, and Decrees, theſe Prelates clearly proceeded. And therefore he, meerly for this only act of refractory diſobedience to the Church, deſerueth, by Gods own iudgment, to be accounted as a Publican or Heathen. So wee ſee, that every man, who diſobeyeth the particular Iudges, iudging clearely accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known Lawes of the Commonwealth, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth the Commonwealth. And it is this refractary diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, and not hearing the Church, which maketh the Crime ſo enormous: For this teacheth others to do the like; and ſo all government falls to confuſion, all Order to diſorder. Whence you may eaſily ſee, that the not obeying and following particular Prelates, in ſo well ordered a Commonwealth as the Church is, doth commonly come to be the very ſelfe ſame enormous Crime of not hearing the Church. And becauſe all particular Prelates of the Church are ſuppoſed (if the contrary be not notorious) to do theyr duty in giveing ſentence according to the known Decrees, orders, and Canons of the vniverſall Church, thoſe who diſobey the Prelates of particular Churches, muſt (by no leſſe generall a manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) be ſayd to diſobey the vniverſall Church; as thoſe, who diſobey the Iudge, are ſayd to diſobey the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

her Court, <hi>let him be accounted as a publican or Heathen</hi> and much more, let him be ſo accounted if he will not heare the Church in ſuch treſpaſſes which one Brother committs againſt all his Brothers, and againſt his Deareſt Mother the Church; this beeing incomparably a crime more haynous, and more particularly belonging to the Court of the Church; over which crime if God had not given her power, he had not given her ſufficient power for her owne preſervation, as every Commonwealth hath, and of neceſſity muſt have; eſpecially ſo ample a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth, as was intended to be dilated over the whole face of the Earth, and to be eſtabliſhed in a vaſt extent for ever. Wherefore as our adverſaries vſe to ſay, that every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Commonwealth muſt needs have power to make Lawes and ſtatutes, of ſufficient efficacy to keep off all forrain Iuriſdiction, by which it may be ruined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as Suarez ſayth (<hi>lib</hi> 3. de Primat.

This Kingdome then, beeing to reigne in the midle of all Nations, he gave it a Spirituall Iuriſdiction over all Nations, in ſo much, as he ſaid to his Church; <hi>The Nation and Kingdome which will not ſerve thee, shall perish of which I ſpeak</hi> more the laſt <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 8: Who ſo ever then broacheth any hereſy, as a poyſoned cup prepared to the ruine, not of one Brothers body; but

And Note that all heretikes are not only guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Soul-Murthering crime of hereſy: but by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt the Prelutes of the Church, in the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of theyr Hereſy, they fall into Schiſme; which Crime of its own Nature (as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> affirmeth) is the moſt haynous treſpaſſe againſt our Brothers, and againſt the moſt ſolemne band of fraternall Charity, that can be committed. If therefore treſpaſſes againſt our Bretheren belong to the Court of the Church, and ſhee is here by God made the Iudge thereof, with that high prerogative of having her Sentence ratifyed in heaven: then doubtles thoſe whom ſhee condemneth are condemned perſons, both in the ſight of God and men. Shee therefore, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great a penalty, beeing to be heard, is ſecured from all kind of errour in her Sentence, or decree.

Here fitly cometh in the diſcuſſing of that (which ſome inconſideratly vſe, to elude the force of this Text;) that this ſentence of the Church conſiſteth only in an exterior excommunication, in which ſhee may erre, and the party (erroneouſly excommunicated) may be a iuſt man in the ſight of God. I anſwer; if wee deceive not our ſelves by putting a Cauſe different from that which concerneth the true vnderſtanding of this text; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſoone be cleered. This text ſpeaketh of one who will not heare, nor ſubmitt to the Church, after ſhee hath given ſentence againſt him: Give mee a man, who, in this caſe, doth not ſubmitt to the Church, and this very not ſubmiſſion of his, cannot but be that very crime, for which <hi>Chriſt</hi> him ſelfe houldeth him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable as a Publican or Heathen; and affirmeth that this ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhall be ratified in heaven: wherefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible this Cenſure ſhould be vniuſt, if he be truly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of not hearing the Church. It is true that by falſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or ſome ſuch way, a man may be iudged to be guilty of not hearing the Church, when really in the ſight of God he is not guilty; and ſo there may ſome times be an errour in the miſtake of the fact: and thus <hi>Clave er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> by an errour only in matter of fact (in which the Church is not infallible,) the ſentence will not be ratified in Heaven. But this is nothing to the purpoſe of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who would have a man be innocent in the ſight of God, who profeſſeth in many particulars not to conforme to what the ſentence of the Church comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all to conforme; for example to adore the Sacred

Euchariſt &amp;c. Every man who profeſſeth this, profeſſeth not to hear the ſentence of the Church, which is ſtill by ſevere Cenſures preſſing this vpon him. Wherefore in pronouncing ſentence here (where the fact of not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church is maynteyned as good and laudable,) there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no errour in the fact: for they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that here they neither do, nor will hear the Church; againſt which they (with <hi>D.

ſelfe? what do wee ſay more? Now I pray, what poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity can there be for you to ſhew by evident Scripture, that this text is not capable of this interpretation, which our Church gives vnto it? In place of ſhewing this (which only maketh to the purpoſe;) you go about to ſhew that text <hi>may have</hi> other interpretations, therefore (you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) this is not the true one: which is a pittifull argument. For what text was ever cited by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or other Apoſtles, which might not have had ſome other interpretation putt vpon it? Thus in place of bringing evident Scripture aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt vs, you ſtill bring your owne interpretations of it; as if Scripture (fallibly interpreted by you) were to be our Iudge. What text have you for that? If you ſay, Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re interpreted truly, muſt be our Iudge; but you do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it truly; therefore Scripture, as you interpret it, muſt be our Iudge. What heretik will not ſay thus much for his damnable interpretations? Tell mee then, what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation can bee demonſtrated to be the only true one, which is different from our interpretation: which ſayth thus; The Church beeing the pillar it ſelfe of truth, wee may, without fear of ever erring, rely vpon her? Shee beeing the very ground of truth it ſelfe; wee are ſecurely grounded, as long as wee are grounded on her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Nothing: But, in place of bringing vs evidence of Scripture, ſo vainly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſted of; you bring vs, for your beſt anſwer, an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of your owne, which you ſay muſt be true, becauſe perhaps it may be true; As if I ſhould ſufficiently prove that <hi>A.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62436:124"/>
To anſwer in the like forme, I may as well ſay; this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of yours muſt be falſe: becauſe perhaps it may be falſe. But let vs heare what your beſt interpretation is. You commonly ſay, there is a double Pillar, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ground: One pillar, or ground which is principall, and that is the Scripture; an other pillar or ground ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the former, and that is the Church. But this double dealing in diſtinguiſhing, helpeth you not. The Church muſt ſtill be a true pillar and a true ground of the truth. <hi>The people beleeved God and Moſes,</hi> ſayth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Ex:</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Moſes</hi> was infinitely vnder God, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to him; as the Church is vnder Scripture and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to it: and yet this did not hinder but that all the people did moſt truly beleeve Moſes, and ground theyr faith on what he ſaid; becauſe they knew he had received what he taught, from God. So all the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the church hath to Scripture, doth not hinder, but that wee may truely rely in our beleefe vpon the Church as the people relyed vpon <hi>Moſes;</hi> becauſe wee alſo know that what the Church teacheth, ſhee hath received from God by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles. Again, the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or doctrine of our Church is as ſecure, as the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or doctrine of the Church in the Law of Nature was for all thoſe two thouſand yeares which were before all Scripture: but then men might (and all did) ſecurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on that Church as the pillar and ground of truth, on which all theyr faith relied: Ergo they may now thus rely on <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church. Again, what clear text have you to prove, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church is leſſe ſecured fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſity, then that Church? Had not this ground been ſure enough (as it had not if that Church had been fallible) the faith of all the world, could not have been grounded ſufficiently
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62436:124"/>
vpon it: And that, which is moſt to our purpoſe, at that very time in which <hi>S. Paul</hi> did call <hi>the Church the Pillar and ground of the truth;</hi> he did call her ſo before the Canon of the Scripture was finiſhed, before which time, you your ſelves confeſſe the Church might be, and was ſecurely relyed vpon, in all points of faith; And no one Chriſtian can, by any text, be proved to have then vnderſtood <hi>S. Paul</hi> to ſpeak theſe words of the Church, as of a pillar and ground of truth ſubordinate to the Canon of Scripture when it ſhould be finiſhed. How then comes this now to be the only true ſenſe of Scripture? what text have you to prove (and that demonſtratively) that the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which, before any word of the new teſtament was written, was the Pillar and ground of truth; and that ſo vniverſally, that ſhee was ſecured from propoſing any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to be beleeved, were it great or litle: but yet ſhee, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vpon the writing of the Scripture (confirming this title vnto her) became leſſe vniverſally a Pillar and ground of truth, and more ſubject to errour then before? You, who will have nothing of moment held without cleer Scripture: ſhew but one ſingle cleer text of Scripture for this. More again of this <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. in the beginning <hi>N.</hi> 1. 2. 3.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. An other ſhift to elude the force of my text, is, to ſay; that by theſe words <hi>S. Paul</hi> intended only to ſet forth the office of the Church, and not her authority. For Gods ſake mark how you handle Scripture againſt vs. You ſay you will bring <hi>evident demonſtration of Scripture,</hi> and now you bring your meer conjectures of <hi>S.

Paul</hi> had only an intention to ſet forth the Churches office, and not her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62436:125"/>
whereas, in fewer words, I think, it ſcarſe poſſible more fully, and more emphatically, to ſett forth her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority, then by tearming her <hi>the Pillar and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und of the Truth;</hi> which words ſtrike ſo ſtrong vpon our vnderſtandings, even at the firſt hearing of them, that the firſt conſequence wee can make from hence is; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon this pillar of truth wee may ſecurely rely in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of truth; Therefore vpon this ground of truth wee may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground our beleefe.</hi> Concerning the office of this Church no man thinketh, vntill he be putt in mind, or hath turned a while his vnderſtanding to the ſearch of ſeverall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. <hi>S. Paul</hi> then vſing words as ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the infallible authority of the Church, as men in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpeach vſe to do, yea, vſing a moſt Expreſſive Metaphore, which cometh fully home to this intent; what do you but tell vs your bare conjectures (and thoſe moſt weakely grounded) when you tell vs, you know his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not to declare the authority of the Church. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me prove this weak conjecture by an other weaker: for they ſay, to what purpoſe was it for <hi>S. Paul</hi> inſtructing Timothy, how to behave himſelfe in the Church of God, to ſet forth vnto him her infallible authority? I anſwer, that is was not only much to the purpoſe to inſtruct all poſterity in one of the moſt neceſſary points; but alſo it was moſt pertinent to that particular end of moving Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy to behave himſelfe irreprehenſibly in the Church, becauſe ſhee was conſtituted the Publike Oracle for all the world, that all in all ages might come to her for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re direction in theyr faith, and for aſſured deciſion of all theyr controverſies (ſhee beeing the Pillar and ground of truth) <hi>S. Paul</hi> thought fitt to admoniſh Timothy, and all other Prelates in his perſon, ſo to behave themſelves,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62436:125"/>
as not, by theyr miſdemeanour, to make men think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that God ſhould give a perpetuall infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to ſuch a Church, whoſe prime and firſt gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (who ſhould be the paterne of the reſt) lived ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly or leſſe Godly. How much do, (not your mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude only) but even your greateſt Doctors, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſay againſt the Church of Rome, claiming this infallibility (yet improbably ſay you;) becauſe her Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes have been avaritious, cruell, laſcivious, or otherwiſe ſcandalous? This indeed is a pittifull argument, for ſo it ſhould be proved improbable that, God aſſiſted infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wicked men to write (without the leaſt errour) ſome parts of the Holy Scripture. And yet wee know David was both an Adulterer and murderer; Salomon was an Idolater, <hi>who went after Aſtoroth the Goddeſſe of the Sidonians, and after Michom the abomination of the Amonites:</hi> 1. Kings 11. <hi>v.</hi> 5.7. Of diverſe bookes wee know not the Authors, and ſo wee cannot tell whether they were good or badde. Yet as pittifull an argument as this is, wee know it troubleth weak Soules; and therefore you vſe it againſt vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to take away all ſcandall from theſe litle ones, it was very convenient that Biſhops, eſpecially thoſe who firſt helde that place in the Church (as Timothie did) ſhould be <hi>blameles, continent, vigilant, ſober, of good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> &amp;c: For ſuch good precepts as theſe were here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>S.

That Church which had no ſuch viſible beeing in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath no ſhare in this promiſe; for who is not the party to which the promiſe is made, hath no part in the promiſe. You then, having no ſhare in it, enviouſly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to leſſen it, by ſaying; that it is not to be vnderſtood that there ſhould be aequality of aſſiſtance in all ages, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Church at all times, from all errour in every age, as ſhee was ſecured in the firſt age, when ſhee was governed by the Apoſtles; And after they had written the Scriptures, there was no further need of any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule; a leſſer aſſiſtance therefore might ſerve af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages. I anſwer that this is only to tell mee what you think might be ſayd: but where is your <hi>evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to demonſtrate that the aſſiſtance God promiſſed was indeed extended to infallibility in the firſt age; but was not ſo in any other age? I aske for infallible texts, and not for fallible reaſons: Though I muſt tell you, that according to reaſon, after the firſt age (when the Church was now grown from a graine of muſtardſeed to be a vaſt tree; extending her branches from Sea to Sea, and ſtill growing to a greater extent) in proceſſe of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62436:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ages, there muſt needs, in ſo huge a compaſſe of the world, imbracing men of different vnderſtandings, dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamens, principles, educations, inſtructions, humors, and wills; there muſt (I ſay) needs happen in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of many ages (ſtill removed further, and further from <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, and the dayes of his Apoſtles) a world of Doubts, debates, and controverſies, ſome affirming ſuch and ſuch Bookes to belong to the true Canon of Scripture, others rejecting them as Apocripha. Some affirming ſuch and ſuch Copies to be the only true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Copies of thoſe Bookes, others affirming thoſe Copies to be corrupted, and others different from them to be the only true ones. And againe after they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon the true Bookes, and the true Copies (though perhaps they might in that agree in a fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) yet they would be ſure mainly to diſagree about the true ſence of thoſe copies. Why then might not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſecure his Church from erring in ſo important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies (vndecidable by Scripture,) promiſe alſo an aſſiſtance extended to infallibility in latter ages, as well as in the firſt age? For infallibility was given to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, not for theyr own ſakes, but for the good of thoſe whom they were to teach, and to ſecure them from errour. Now the Chriſtian people of after ages were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more in number, and theyr very number made them incomparably more ſubject (in proceſſe of many ages ſtill remoter from Chriſt) to be led into inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable errours; wherefore ſurely they did exceedingly need this infallible aſſiſtance, given, as I ſayd, for the peoples ſake. Thoſe who had been inſtructed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, before Scripture was written, converted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thouſands, who never had heard any Apoſtle
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:62436:127"/>
preach: All theſe Beleeved vpon the authority of the then preſent Church, and theyr faith was infallible; therefore that Church, which was then before Scripture, had an infallible aſſiſtance to ſecure her from propoſing any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. What Scripture tells you ſhee loſt this aſſiſtance when Scripture was written? And that men could not rely vpon her authority, when now, beſides the help of tradition, ſhe had alſo the help of Scripture, to rule her ſelfe by? See this more fully <hi>S.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 2. You ſay, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance was leſſe neceſſary for her after ſhee had received the Scripture. I might ſay, it was more neceſſary; becauſe in proceſſe of time heretikes would ariſe, who would affirme the Scriptures to have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purpoſely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be our ſole and only Rule of Faith; and this they would ſay of Scripture as interpreted by them, and not as interpreted by any infallible, viſible interpreter. This he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, into which all heretikes have ever fallen, maketh the neceſſity of an infallible aſſiſtance greater after the writing of Scripture, then it was before. Again, what Scripture tels you that God is ſo ſparing in his providing meanes for the direction of his Church, that, giving them Scripture, he will ſubtract his aſſiſtance formerly extended to infallibility, and not leave them, with theyr Bibles in theyr hands, to go which way every one in his private judgment ſhall think fitteſt, with out the former direction of a publik, viſible, and infallible guide? Had wee not better have kept ſuch a guide ſtill? <hi>D. Ferne</hi> could not but acknowledge, <hi>that ſuch a viſible infallible Iudge, or Vmpire of all Chriſtendome, would (if to be had) be a ready meanes to compoſe all differences, and reſtore truth and Peace. S.</hi> 27. The Church was this infallible viſible Iudge before Scripture was written; and it is alſo confeſſed, that ſuch
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62436:127"/>
a Iudge would now, after wee have the Scripture, be an exceeding benefitt: why then do you ſay, God took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this ineſtimable guift from his Church with one hand, when he gave the Scripture with the other; there not beeing the leaſt text in Scripture for ſo important an aſſertion? I think any one would hould it moſt raſh to ſay, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> after he had writt the laſt words of the whole Canon or Scripture, preſently loſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in teaching, inſtructing guyding, interpreting &amp;c: Why then ſhould the whole Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> looſe that infallibility which confeſſedly ſhee had before the Canon was quite finiſhed? Again, you cannot ſay the Scripture was ſuperfluouſly written, though the Church, before the writing thereof, was an infallible guide: How then can you ſay the infallible guidance of the Church is ſuperfluous, after the writing of the Scripture? eſpecially, beeing ſuch an infallible guidance is even now confeſſed to be ſo ready a meanes to end all controverſies; which among thoſe who admitt no ſuch guides, are endles. See alſo my next <hi>Sect: n.</hi> 1. 2. 3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore, not only in the firſt age, but even to the conſummation of the world, is with his Church; But he is not with thoſe who introduce, and father vpon him, as the firſt Reuealer thereof, many groſſe, and intolerable Errours, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, as you call thoſe which you found in all Churches vpon the face of the Earth, this laſt thouſand years: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe laſt thouſand yeares he was not with his Church, or elſe her errours were not ſuch as needed ſo ſadde a Reformation as yours was, to the diſturbance of all Chriſtendom. If her errours were tolerable, they ſhould (to auoid ſo great miſcheefes) have been tolerated: if they vere intolerable, how was <hi>Chriſt</hi> with her? Or what
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62436:128"/>
other Church can you name whoſe errours were not as intolerable? Now that all may clearly ſee, that this promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſſured the Church of an aſſiſtance extended to an infallible ſecurity from all errour fundamentall, or not fundamentall: this will appear by that farther, and fuller explication made of this promiſe in <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> who writt on purpoſe to explicate more fully ſome points, leſſe fully ſet down by the former Evangeliſts.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>My eleuenth text</hi> then is out of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> where <hi>C.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 15.

In theſe things <hi>this Spirit will guide you into all Truth.</hi> But all Truth exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Errours, not only in fundamentall, but alſo in not-fundamentall points. You know not which points be fundamentall, which not; which deſtructive of Salvation, which not; which curable, which incurable; Yet feare not: beleeve the Church in teaching theſe, or any other points; for ſhee, guided by this Spirit of Truth, will guide you into all Truth: But you will ſay, How long ſhall her cheefe Paſtors have this great privilege? <hi>For ever,</hi> ſayth the firſt part of my Text; by which words it is made evident
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:62436:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the promiſe was made, not only to them for themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves (they not beeing to live <hi>for ever</hi> teaching vs theſe Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes;) but alſo for they Succeſſours in the prime govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, who were to guide the People into all Truth <hi>for ever;</hi> as I ſhall preſently ſhew farther out of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> I argue hence (iuſt as I did before;) This aſſiſtance which was promiſſed <hi>for ever,</hi> was <hi>ever,</hi> and in all ages, performed; therefore in thoſe ten ages (which made the thouſand yeares before your Reformation) this promiſe was performed; Therefore what All the prime Prelates of the Church did teach all that while for truth, was not erroneous, or ſuperſtitious: But in all theſe ages they all confeſſedly did teach for truth thoſe very points, which you hould to be our groſſeſt errours; Therefore theſe be not errours, but truth. Here you ſee againe clearly, why this great promiſe cannot belong to your Prelats or other Governours of your Church, as it is different from ours. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe you had no viſible governours at all of your Church as diſtinct from ours. For Governours muſt needs be viſibly choſen, have viſible ſubjects, ſend forth viſible decrees &amp;c. Name ſuch governours as theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours, if you can. You can name none but ours. With ours then only <hi>the Holy Ghoſt abided</hi> all theſe ages, <hi>guiding them into all Truth.</hi> Whence <hi>Secondly</hi> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he cannot now be guiding your governours into all truth; they beeing manifeſtly guided into opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions directly oppoſit to thoſe doctrines which were, all theſe laſt thouſand yeares, taught by all thoſe who were governours of the Church. If you could ſhew governours of Churches in all theſe laſt ten ages ſtill teaching thoſe points in which you differ from vs, without teaching other notorious errours; then indeed you might have
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:62436:129"/>
ſome colour to plead; that this Spirit of Truth might as truly have been ſayd promiſed to the governours of your Church, as to thoſe of ours: But this promiſe, not beeing performed to them (there beeing no ſuch perſons to be found in thoſe ages) was not doubtles promiſed to them; otherwiſe <hi>Chriſts</hi> promiſe had not been performed.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>My twelfth and laſt Text,</hi> ſhewing clearly that this promiſed aſſiſtance was extended to infallibility, is. <hi>Epheſ:</hi> 4. Whence appeareth that the end, and intention of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in giving the chiefe Gouvernours of that Church (which was to be viſible in all Ages) was ſuch an end, and ſuch an intention, as could not be compaſſed by giving vs ſuch cheefe Gouvernours, guides and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in beleefe, as were meerly fallible, and who might lead vs into circumvention of errour, even then, when they were legally aſſembled togeather to deliver the Truth, from theyr higheſt Tribunall, in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. For had all theſe our cheefe Gouvernours, even then, been lyable to broach groſſe errours, vented for divine verities (and preſſed vpon all to be admitted as ſuch) how had <hi>Chriſt</hi> obtained that end for which he gave vs theſe our prime Gouvernours, guides and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors? <hi>For he gave ſome Apoſtles</hi> (ſucceeding alwaies in full Apoſtolicall authoritie, as wee ſee in <hi>S.

To elude ſome of my texts, our adverſaries vſe to ſay; wee muſt indeed hear the Church, as long as ſhee teaceth what is conformable to Scripture: and ſo long the gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile againſt her; ſo long, and no longer, ſhee is the pillar <hi>and</hi> ground of truth, and God is with her &amp;c.

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt reaſon, why the Church muſt needs be furniſhed with ſome infallible meanes beſides the vſe of Scripture, (which vſe is not infallible though the Scriptures be infallible) is taken out of that which I touched vpon (<hi>S.</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 13.) to wit; that there is no Reaſon, nor any one ſingle text, teaching that the Church in the Law of Nature, ſhould be ſaid to be priviledged with infallibility, above the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Law of grace: But the Church in the Law of Nature, which laſted for two thouſand yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res (vntill the firſt writing of Scripture by <hi>Moſes</hi>) was all that while infallible in propoſing true traditions, and not ſo much as lyable to propoſe falſe ones. This I prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the faith which the true beleeving people had in thoſe two thouſand yeares was infallible, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed only on the propoſall of the Church; propoſing ſuch, or ſuch a point as received from God revealing to <hi>Adam</hi> or ſome other Patriarch thoſe verities: for example, that they were to obſerve the ſabboth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. the diſtinction between cleane and vncleane beaſts a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meates, <hi>Gen:</hi> 7. and <hi>Gen:</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>That the ſoule is</hi> immortall; that the rewards and puniſhments of the next life laſted for ever; that they
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:62436:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> conceived in originall Sinne; that ſuch, and ſuch remedies, were to be vſed to free them ſelves and theyr children from it; what repentance they were to vſe; how faſt they were to ſtand to theyr traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how they were to account it a moſt damnable Sinne to forſake them &amp;c. This was the faith of all true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the world, which for two thouſand yeares had no other ground then the revelation of God, as propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the tradition of the Church preſent to all believers in every age, in which theſe beleevers lived. And though theyr Tradition was inferior to ours, as I ſhewed in the place now cited, yet the Church then, in every age, was infallible in propovnding that which they had once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Revelation: And the beleevers of each Age reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the infallible authority which theyr preſent Church had in propounding thoſe divine verities, <hi>had the ſame ſpirit of faith,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. The misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers then had the ſame Spirit alſo which they have now in oppoſing the Churches tradition. This Spirit, before the flood, was in <hi>Cain,</hi> who, as <hi>Thargum Hieroſolymita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> ſayth, <hi>proteſted to Abel that there was no Iuſtice, nor Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, nor other world then this, nor noe reward for vertue, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for Sinn:</hi> And perhaps he vſed the argument which <hi>D.

of Cain;</hi> addeth (<hi>v:</hi> 14.) <hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeuenth from Adam propheſied of theſe ſaying, behould our Lord cometh in his holy thouſands to do iudgement vpon all, and to convince all that are vngodly amongſt them of theyr vngodly deeds.</hi> After <hi>Noës</hi> flood, theſe denyers of Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beeing extinguiſhed; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Arch-heretike, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> wittneſeth <hi>l.</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> as the keeping of the ſabbath <hi>&amp;c:</hi> And ſome five hundered yeares before God gave the firſt Scripture to the Children of Iſrael only, he did ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Abraham from all other Nations, giving afterwards vnto him and his, the precept of Circumciſion (<hi>Gen:</hi> 17.) which precept (though no Scripture could be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhewed) was, for above four hundered yeares, obſerved by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity as a neceſſary precept. Vpon tradition alſo they beleeved the Covenant God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the Father of Many Nations; and that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias ſhould be borne of his ſeed. Then after <hi>Moſes</hi> his dayes Scripture was written, but given only to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael: No other Nation beeing bound to ſubmitt to this Law. All other nations, as they had then ſeverall true beleevers among them, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſeperated from them, ſo there is not the leaſt mention of theyr to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall decay in beleefe after that ſeparation; all they then ſtill beleeved what they had beleeved before, vpon the ſame ground as they did before, neither were the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures promulged among them. And thus true faith might be preſerved amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many who never heard of Scripture, vntill <hi>Chriſts</hi> time; that is for an other two thouſand yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:62436:132"/>
and more. Iuſt ſo true faith, even aften <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, was preſerved among many without any Scripture; as I ſhall by and by ſhew. But to go on; wee read that <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends (when or whereſoever they lived) lived not among the progeny of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and yet <hi>Iob</hi> was moſt eminent in vertue and true faith, and his friends (and probably many of his and theyr neighbours) beleeved in one God, held the reſurrection of the fleſh, and that God ſhould iudge all according to theyr works, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other points, relying ſtill vpon only Tradition. Why ſhould the Tradition of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church be more fallible then theyrs was? As I argued <hi>Sect:</hi> 13. ſee that place, and alſo what I ſaid <hi>Sect:</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 13. and you will ſee that there is farre greater reaſon why our Tradition ſhould be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited more them theyrs. Is not <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church nobler then theyrs? Did God give them any meanes fitter to ſecure theyr Traditions from beeing falſified, then he gave his Church: Could Tradition be an infallible ground for above 4000. yeares before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and can it not have been ſo ever ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> for 1657. yeares. Adde alſo to this, that the children of Iſrael, though they had the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, yet they had not all neceſſary points written in theyr Scripture, but did rely wholy vpon the Tradition of theyr Church for the truth of them; as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 10. <hi>n:</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My ſecond reaſon, to prove the Church is provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſome infallible meanes for the ſecure direction of her Children, is, that not only from the begining of the world to <hi>Chriſts</hi> preaching his new Ghoſpel, the infallible faith of ſeverall true beleevers had no other ground but the infallibility of theyr reſpectively preſent Church, in propoſing the Traditions ſhee had receaved; but alſo the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:62436:133"/>
firſt true beleevers in <hi>Chriſt</hi> relyed in theyr faith vpon the infallibility of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church, not having any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ground but her authority, affirming that ſhee, by Tradition? had received ſuch and ſuch points taught her by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles. See what I ſaid in my laſt <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 16. This manner of beleeving, even our owne Proteſtant adverſaries confeſſe to have been infallible vntill the whole Canon of the Scripture was written, and divulged, which was ſome 70. or fourſcore yeares after <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now how this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ſecurity relying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church, which, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begining of the world vnto the finiſhing of the laſt book of Scripture a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d publiſhing of the ſame, had been the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> practiſe of true beleevers, did prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly turne to be Popiſh, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnlawfull, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceave: But I a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure all our adverſaries ſtoutly affirme that it is ſo; and here theyr part is affirmative, and affirmative of the vnlawfulnes of that which from the begining of the world was ever lawfull vnto that day. Wherefore to plead aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt ſo long a preſcription (that the world was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a longer) for introducing a new obligation of not beleeving vpon a ground which had been, for above four thouſand yeares, able to beare all the faith of the world, <hi>evidence of Scripture</hi> ought to be brought: What then more reaſonable then to ask of them to cite at leaſt one ſingle cleare Text, commanding all the beleevers of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church to give over relying vpon her authority, as now never to be any more infallible after the finiſhing and publiſhing of the laſt booke of Scripture? Our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cannot bring any ſuch text affirming this clearly, without wee will be pleaſed to take theyr fallible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded interpretations to be a ground ſure enough to make the Texts reach home to the proof of what wee
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:62436:133"/>
dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: which cannot be allowed by vs; becauſe, by theyr owne confeſſion, theyr interpretation is fallible: And wee muſt have an infallible ground to overthrow an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority, ſtanding ſure even from the begining of the world. Call then, and call again and again; for this text, and be ſure to allow no Interpretation to help the text to reach home, but ſuch as can, by clear Scripture, be ſhewed to convince that the Text tells you evidently, that after the finiſhing and publiſhing of the laſt book of Scripture, no body was ever to rely vpon the Churches authority, now grown fallible, though ever before infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Do but ſtand cloſe to this, and theyr vain boaſt of demonſtrating this by Scripture, will fall down dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy feet to be trampled vpon by thee. Yea, not to condemne theyr own Bretheren the Lutherans (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Apocalyps or Revelations to be Scripture) they will tell thee that for diverſe ages this Book was not known to be certain Scripture, and yet perhaps this was the very laſt Booke of Scripture, vntil the publiſhing of which the infallibility of the Church was to laſt. If this be ſo then, you muſt allow it probable that the infallibility of the Church laſteth vntill this very day, for any certainty wee have of the contrary: For your Lutheran Bretheren will ſay, that Book of the Apocalyps was never as yet ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently publiſhed to the Church to be Scripture; for if it were ſo, they neyther could, nor would reject it. <hi>Secondly</hi> it ſeemeth inconceptible how the writeing and publiſhing ſuch a Scripture, as was at laſt written and publiſhed, ſhould, without any diſtincter declaration then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by litle and litle (that is, as people were pleaſed to copy it out) ſhould make invalide the hitherto-infallible authority of this Church: there beeing in this Scripture
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:62436:134"/>
twelue texts at the leaſt (as I have ſhewed in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Sections) recommending to all, the authority of the Church; beſides divers others bidding them hould ſtill her Traditions, and inculcating this over and over again; as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 9. Traditions do not grow weaker, but ſtronger, by being witneſſed alſo by writing; and the more authority the writing hath, the more ſtrength is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former tradition: For example, wee know by tradition there is ſuch a place as the Indies, where gould is to be found; but when our own fleetes come to go thither, and fetch the gould from thence, and in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony there-of ſtampe goulden peeces with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Brought by our fleet from the Indies;</hi> and when Acts of Parliament come to be ſet forth concerning the value of ſuch, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch peeces: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſay this goulde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-printed-teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony comes forth, is not the former traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grown rather more, then become leſſe credible? So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer moſt credible traditions come to be now written in the goulde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> letters of the Scriptures, and of ſuch Scriptures as commanded Traditions to be held; and commanded again and againe the Church to be heard, followed, obeyed, relyed vpon as the very pillar and ground of truth; is not her authority and the credit of her Traditions rather increaſed, then leſſened, by this goulden and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne writing? Again; it was wholy neceſſary that if after the finiſhing of the Canon, the Church was no longer to be infallible, that notice thereof, by ſome very publike Decree, or Act, ſhould have been given to all the people in the Church; that they might not go on, grounding theyr fayth vpon the infallible tradition of this Church, as they did before; leaſt ſo doing they ſhould rely now, not vpon the pillar and ground of truth, but vpon a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62436:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
authority. That this was done you can prove by noe kinde of teſtimony.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But I can prove, by a moſt grave teſtimony, that, long after the finiſhing of the Canon of Scripture, the faithfull beleevers ſtill held on theyr former manner of relying in theyr whole Faith wholy vpon the infallible authority of the Church: juſt as I ſaid before that, when <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Scripture to the Iewes, the faithfull people among the Gentiles had not theſe Scriptures, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill to beleeve vpon Tradition only (See my firſt Number:) My teſtimony is out of S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who was diſciple to <hi>S. Polycarp,</hi> though he lived a hundred and fourſcore yeares after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This ſaint, in that vnqueſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work of his againſt <hi>Valentinus. L.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 4. Where he ſheweth, in what manner wee were all to beleeve the ſame things which now wee do beleeve, although there were no Scripture at all; and he ſheweth this by ſhewing how, even after the writing of Scripture, many whole Nations did beleeve, who had never ſeen the Scripture, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as an infallible Rule) that order of Tradition which had from hand to hand been dilivered to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church; and by them to the Churches of which they reſpectively had charge. For thus he ſpeaketh; <hi>What if the Apoſtles had not left vs the Scriptures? Muſt wee not have followed that order of Tradition which they delivered to thoſe to whoſe charge they left the Churches to be governed? To this order of Tradition</hi> (by the vnwritten word) <hi>many barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations do aſſent, who have beleeved in Chriſt without any Writings, keeping diligently the ancient Traditions.</hi> Note, that he calleth theſe Traditions <hi>ancient</hi> becauſe they had ſtood a good while after the finiſhing of the Canon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time all Nations beleeved meerly on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:62436:135"/>
as I ſayd, and before which time, no one tradition of Chriſtian faith could be <hi>ancient.</hi> Hence then <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> proueth, that wee might beleeve with divine faith, vpon the ſole account of, or meerly relying vpon, that very tradition, which the Apoſtles <hi>de facto</hi> left to thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they left the government of the Church; although the Apoſtles had never written any thing at any time. <hi>S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> therefore did beleeve that the tradition <hi>de facto</hi> left by the Apoſtles, was a ſufficient ground to vphould divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and infallible faith; and conſequently that it was infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: So that vpon it meerly, whole nations might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: For, if he had not thought that they had beleeved meerly vpon tradition, but had only by it been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to take the Scripture for theyr ground; he could not hence have ſhewed (to ſhew which he brought this proofe) in what Meaſure wee had all been obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all the points of our Chriſtian faith, although never any Scripture at all had been at any time to be written; in which caſe it had been impoſſible for our beleefe to have had any kind of Relation to Scripture. And becauſe the beleefe of theſe Nations had no ſuch Relation, this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was to his purpoſe: which otherwiſe had not been So. Now what <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> ſayth muſt needs in all reaſon have been true; for the Scripture by the Apoſtles was only written in Greek, and ſome very few parts in the Hebrew then currant: A vaſt multitude of Nations vnderſtood not theſe languages, as I have ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 9. neither did the Apoſtles take any care to procure the Scripture to be turned into the languages of every converted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had a different toung; For had they done So, divers of theſe tranſlations would either have been for ſome ages exta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or at leaſt ſome memory of them; where
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:62436:135"/>
as there is not the leaſt ſigne of any ſuch thing. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin toung was by the Romanes impoſed vpon moſt of thoſe many Nations, which were converted in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Age, and the Ages following: wherefore a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would think that in the firſt place, or among the very firſt, this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage would have bene choſen by the Apoſtles for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Scriptures, if the Scriptures had been the only ground to be relyed vpon in faith: Yet for all this you will not graunt our vulgar Edition (which you graunt to be the moſt ancient of all Latin Editions) to have been ſet forth by any command given by the Apoſtles, or by any one of theyr immediate Succeſſours, or to have been approved by them: from hence then wee manifeſtly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Apoſtles eſteemed that very tradition, which they delivered to theſe to whome they committed the government of the Church, to be a moſt ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ground to ſupport infallible faith: And conſequently they held ſuch traditions infallible, leaving them for the only gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und of faith to the farre greater part of the Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which they converted; to whom they delivered no Scripture at all in theyr own toung, nor left any Command (that can be proved) that Scripture ſhould be (preſently after the finiſhing of the Canon) delivered to them in theyr own languages; for had this been done, ſome of theyr Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would have been kept. If you ſay they had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though in Greek only. I anſwer, that thoſe who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not Greek, are never the neerer for having a Greek book. Why did not <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> (who writt in Greek even to the Romans themſelves) at that time they ſtayed in the Latin Church, procure or order the Scriptures to be putt in Latin; if, without grounding our ſelves vpon Scripture in every point of beleefe, no part
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:62436:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our beleefe, which is not ſo grounded, can be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And hence cleerly and orderly followeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>My third reaſon,</hi> That no man now hath any infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible faith, but he who relyeth vpon the Tradition of the preſent Church, as an infallible ground. This I prove out of what hath been by mee already demonſtrated. Firſt, for the moſt learned ſorte that be in the world, they cannot know, by any ground which is infallible, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Tradition of the Church be infallible,) which Bookes the Prophets or Apoſtles did write, which not; as I have ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. Nor which be the true vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted originall Copies, which not; as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 4. and therefore they muſt rely in theſe two points, (vpon which no leſſe then all theyr faith doth rely,) vpon the Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church as infallible; for a fallible Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be a ſufficient ground to ſupport an infallible faith: either then they have no ſuch faith, or they muſt allow Tradition to be infallible. As for thoſe who are not ſo lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to vnderſtand Hebrew and Greek, or who have not meanes to know which Copyes be vncorrupted in Greek or Hebrew; They muſt beleeve this but by meer humane authority, if they refuſe the Churches Tradition; So by and by: <hi>n:</hi> 7. And ſo for Tranſlations, which be the very prime conveighers of all that is in Scripture, to thoſe who vnderſtand not Greek, and Hebrew; either theſe men muſt rely vpon the word of God, as conveyed vnto them by ſuch fallible men, as I have ſhewed theyr Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators to be, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. or, farre more wiſely, they muſt rely vpon the Tradition of the Church as infallible: And if they do not, theyr faith will ever be fallible, as I have ſhewed. Again, it is not the bare letter of Scripture which can be a Rule or ground of faith vnto vs; but it is the ſenſe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:62436:136"/>
of this letter interpreted according to the true minde of the holy Ghoſt: Now the private interpretation, which any particular Mans Witt, or learning, or Spirit can give to this bare letter, is fallible; even though he ſhall exactly obſerve thoſe 20. Severall Rules of which I ſpake <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>n:</hi> 7: for theſes Rules are all fallible; wherefore the bare letter, taken in the ſenſe that wee, by our privat witt, learning, and Spirit imagin, and meerly conjecture it to be taken, is not the infallible ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore no ground of faith, even to thoſe moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men who are able to vſe exactly all thoſe twenty Rules. See the place laſt cited. But as for all that vaſt multitude which cannot vnderſtand perfectly Hebrew and Greek, it is impoſſible for them to obſerve thoſe twenty Rules (of which one ſuppoſeth perfect skill in Hebrew and Greek:) wherefore it beeing our adverſaries own doctrine that, without the exact obſervance of all theſe 20. Rules, the infallible ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be infallibly known to any one, but only fallibly: after all that ſtill fallible induſtry, it is a cleare demonſtration, that thoſe who know not Greek and Hebrew, cannot know infallibly what the Scripture biddeth them do or beleeve; they not beeing able infallibly to know the ſenſe of the bare letter, which ſenſe (you ſay) is the only Rule and direction of faith, and the only infallible ground vpon which all divine faith muſt rely. Wherefore almoſt all mankind, who is vnskilfull in Greek and Hebrew, muſt firſt have not only the letter of the Scripture faithfully delivered vnto them vpon truſt of the Tranſlators; But Secondly, this muſt be done after that theſe Tranſlators have made an vnqueſtionable choice of ſure vncorrupted Originall Copyes, (in which choice it is not poſſible for
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:62436:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to proceed, but very fallibly as I ſhewed, <hi>Sect:</hi> 5.) Thirdly alſo they muſt have the ſenſe of the letter deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered truly and aſſuredly vnto them. I aske, by whom? You ſay, by your Miniſters. Then (ſay I) you rely vpon the witt, skill and Spirit of thoſe Miniſters. Is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved infallible? No. How then is your faith infallible? As for vs, wee rely vpon the vnanimous tradition of thoſe Governours of our Churches to whom the Apoſtles, with that charge, delivered all the important points of our faith, as well by word of Mouth, as by dayly practice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable therevnto: commanding them to deliver to all in theyr Churches (among whom were theyr future Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors) the ſame points both by word of Mouth, and by the anſwerable practice, iuſt as they had received. In like manner theyr Succeſſors ſucceſſively were directed and commanded to proceede. No writing (as I ſhall ſhew <hi>Sect:</hi> 19. <hi>n.</hi> 4.5.6. &amp;c.) can, with ſo full aſſurednes, bring down to our age, what was taught and practiſed in the firſt age, as perpetuall Tradition of the ſame doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, confirmed by the continuance of the ſame practice firſt received, and never able to be ſhewed to have been altered or changed. Vpon this Tradition wee are ſure that wee beleeve as groundedly, at the leaſt, as all the true beleevers did for the firſt two thouſand yeares before any Scripture was written: And as groundedly as all the Gentiles (for only Iewes had the Scripture) beleeved at any time after wards: And as groundedly as the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved ſtill ſome things only vpon Tradition; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what remedy was to be vſed to take away Originall Sinne from theyr female-Children, or from theyr male-Children dying before theyr Circumciſion on the eight day: And again, as groundedly as thoſe many Nations,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:62436:137"/>
converted by the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, beleeved after the Scripture was finiſhed; though they never had ſo much as ſeen Scripture; but wholy relied, in theyr whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, <hi>vpon the ancient tradition received from them from whom the governours of theyr Churches had originally received theyr gouernments</hi> and authority; to witt, from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; as I ſhewed out of <hi>S. Irenaeus.</hi> Tradition then of theſe Governours of our Churches, delivered vnanimouſly by them, maketh the points ſo delivered now as evidently credible, and as fitt Objects of divine faith, as it made the points delivered then by theyr Governours or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; Wherefore wee have as good reaſon now, to take what is thus propoſed for truth revealed by God, to be indeed ſo; and conſequently to be imbraced with ſo fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and immoveable adheſion of vnderſtanding, and will; that the preaching of the contrary by an Angel from Heaven ſhould not ſtagger our beleefe therein: And wee have as good reaſon to proceed thus in our beleefe, as all thoſe, I ſpoak of, had to proceed ſo in theyr beleefe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. My fourth reaſon hence deduced is, that Chriſt him ſelfe expecteth and exacteth an infallible aſſent of faith to be given to any point, which is confirmed by miracle from Heaven; and ſuch an aſſent hath a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to ſupport its infallibility. <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth theſe Miracles <hi>a teſtimony greater then Iohn. Mark</hi> 5. Yea a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (in order to vs) greater then his own word; <hi>If you will not beleeve mee, beleeve my works.</hi> He calleth that a kinde of ſure knowledge which is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a miracle; So <hi>Matt:</hi> 9. <hi>v:</hi> 6. <hi>But that you may know that the Sonne of man hath power on Earth to forgive Sinnes, he ſayth to the man Sicke of the palſie: Ariſe, take vp thy bed, and go into thine houſe.</hi> You ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> vſed the teſtimony
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:62436:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this one miracle, as ſufficient to make <hi>them know</hi> the truth of his having power to forgive Sinnes. Miracles then grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a ſure knowledge of faith, or an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what they confirme: But the Tradition of the Church maketh that which it witneſeth to be as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as evidently credible in order to vs, as this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the man ſicke of the palſie, or any ſuch Miracle can do; therefore this Tradition may be as ſolid a ground of an infallible aſſent, as a miracle: I prove it clearly thus. Let any man ſpeak as he thinks in the fight of God, and he will plainly confeſſe, that to be moſt true which I am going to ſay. I ſay then, that though a man had lived in the Country all his life, and never had ſeen London; yet be (meerly vpon the teſtimony of Tradition) would ſo fully beleeve that there is ſuch a Citty as London, and that it is the Head Town of England: that neither I, not you can prudently conceave how the teſtimony of any one miracle (wrought on pourpoſe to prove that there is ſuch a Citty as London) ſhould make it more evidently credible vnto him, that there is ſuch a Cittie, without the Teſtimony of any Tradition; then Tradition hath made it without the Teſtimony of any miracle: whence you ſee Tradition wins beliefe as powerfully as any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. True it is, this Tradition wee ſpoak of is but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and ſo be the motives of Credibility making it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible that God, by his Apoſtles, affirmed ſuch or ſuch a point vnto the firſt beleevers of the Church. But when it is once made to mee as evidently credible that God hath revealed ſuch and ſuch verities, as it is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by human tradition that there is ſuch a Cittie as Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then preſently (by the grace of God) I conclude; that it beeing ſo credible that God hath ſaid ſuch, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62436:138"/>
ſuch a thing, that I cannot in prudence no more doubt that he hath ſaid it, then I can doubt there is ſuch a Citty as London: I beeing thus aſſured, am by my dutie to God bound to yeeld that ſubmiſſion of my vnderſtanding to this ſaying of God, which is fitt to be yeelded to the word of a God, which word cannot (without blaſphemous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety) be held ſubject to the leaſt fallibility. And therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re what by Tradition is made ſo evidently credible to mee, to have been revealed by God to this Church; ought to be accepted by mee, as the word of God. Whence I ought to account it blaſphemous impiety to doubt of the trutht of it, and conſequently I ought to hould it infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as far from all poſſibility of beeing falſe as Gods word is. And beeing that this very ſelfe ſame tradition tells mee, that the ſame God who revealed by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo many other Verities to his Church, did alſo reveale, by the ſame Apoſtles, to the ſame Church, that this Church was to be heard as the Miſtris of truth, with whom he would ever be preſent, ſuggeſting her all truth and never permitting the gates of Hell to preuail againſt her; but that he placed her as a Pillar, and ground of truth; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her ſuch Paſtours, as ſhould ſecure her Children from beeing toſſed to and fro wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:62436:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the queſtionleſſe Truth of her Traditions. Wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I yielded that ſubmiſſion of my vnderſtanding to this ſaying of God, which was fitt to be yielded to the word of a God, which word I could not without blaſphemous impiety ſuſpect to be any way lyable to fallibility.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Here, by the way, out of what hath been now ſayd, wee may eaſely clear two common difficulties. The firſt is, how wee do committ noe vitious circle in our faith: For though firſt wee beleeve the Scripture to be Gods word, becauſe the Church, which is infallible, tould vs ſo: Yet, when again wee are asked, why wee firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Church to be infallible? wee do not ſay (as our adverſaries would needs make vs ſay, whether wee would or no) that wee firſt beleeve our Church to be infallible, becauſe the Scripture tould vs the Church was infallible; But wee anſwer, that wee firſt beleeve the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be infallible by her Tradition delivered her by the Apoſtles before any Scripture was made; which tradition maketh things ſo evidently credible, as I have iuſt now declared, that even a miracle wrought purpoſely to confirme ſuch a point maketh not that point more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible. Tradition therefore is a ground able to ſupport an infallible aſſent. Well then, I beleeve <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been crucified becauſe the Scripture ſayth ſo: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Scripture, becauſe the Church by her tradition, ſaith the Scripture to be Gods word; I beleeve the Church, and her tradition, for its own credibility. If you ask mee why I do ſo? I anſwer, becauſe I will do prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a matter of ſo great conſequence; that is, I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, and I will captivitate my vnderſtanding in ſuch manner, as to yield all firme aſſent, which (by God his grace) I poſſibly can do, vnto that, which the Church
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62436:139"/>
by her Tradition propoſeth vnto mee as Gods true word; vpon which word my vnderſtanding ſhall be fixed ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably, that no <hi>Angels</hi> words ſhall move mee from it: ſee <hi>Sect:</hi> 23. <hi>n:</hi> 5 6. Hence you ſee to what my vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleaveth ſo faſt; to witt, to Gods true word propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church, or her vnanimous Tradition. Now if you ask mee; why my will is ſo reſolute in making choice of thus ſubmitting, and thus captivating my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? I eaſely anſwer; becauſe my vnderſtanding hath evidently Seen (I do not then go blindely to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, (as our adverſaries conceive wee all do <hi>Sect.</hi> 8:) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my vnderſtanding hath evidently ſeen that, even according to all reaſon, prudence, and piety, it is moſt vnreaſonable, imprudent and impious, not to yield this ſubmiſſion of vnderſtanding to that which is evidently credible to be Gods word; and that to the full as that which is confirmed by miracle: For what is affirmed by the Churches vnanimous Tradition, is no leſſe evidently credible then what is confirmed by miracle, (as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the very laſt Number;) Therefore (and in many other reſpects) it is moſt vnreaſonable, moſt imprudent, and impious, not to yield all poſſible ſubmiſſion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to that which is propoſed as Gods word, by the vnanimous Tradition of the Church. It is madnes not to beleeve what is made evidently credible, even then when heaven, is offered vnto mee if I will beleeve it, and when hell is infallibly to be my puniſhment, if I will not beleeve it. For ſo our Sauiour himſelfe ſaid, when men had only Tradition to rely on (to witt, before any word of that new Scripture was written) <hi>He that beleeueth and is baptized, shall be ſaved; but he that beleeveth not shall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> (Mark 16 <hi>v.</hi> 15.) And many were damned for not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62436:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beleeving the Church, before either the ould Scripture was written in the Law of Nature, and before the finiſhing of the new teſtament in the firſt ſeaventy yeares after <hi>Chriſts</hi> paſſion; and after the finiſhing of it alſo, many were damned for not beleeving among thoſe Nations to whom the faith, without any Scripture was ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that thouſands of them were moſt true believers, meerly grounding theyr whole faith vpon the Church and her vnanimous Tradition.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Second difficulty (which may eaſely be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by what hath been here ſaid) is, how the ignorant vulgar ſorte come to imbrace our faith, and all the points of it, with an infallible aſſent, and that prudently? whence will appeare that Tradition is the fitteſt deliverer of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, and the moſt proportionable to the capacity of the incomparably greater part of the world. For no man, who is above the degree of a foole, is ſo ignorant, but by ſuch carefull ſearch, as all are bound to vſe in finding out the way to theyr laſt end (which is eternall Salvation;) he will preſently find, that the vnanimous Tradition of our preſent Church propoſeth ſuch and ſuch points to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved as beeing points reveled by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Apoſtles to the Church, for example, <hi>the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Death and Reſurrection of our Saviour, his having planted vpon Earth an infallible Church for our direction</hi> &amp;c: Then having found this to be the vnanimous conſent, and Tradition of our Church, he may eaſily be made capable how evidently credible that is which is propoſed by the Tradition of ſuch a Church. Firſt, becauſe all thoſe who beleeved for the firſt two thouſand yeares, did beleeve all that they beleeved vpon a weaker Tradition then this is, as I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed before: Secondly, he may alſo eaſily vnderſtand
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62436:140"/>
how true it is which I ſayd <hi>n.</hi> 5. that no miracle can move a man ſo effectually to beleeve that there is ſuch a place as London, as Tradition doth move him there vnto: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore as miracles can beget an infallible aſſent, ſo alſo may Tradition. Thirdly, he can vnderſtand that the Churches Tradition is ſecured by God, from deceiving vs; for elſe all the faith of thoſe millions and millions (to whom God gave no other ground but this to ground that faith which he, vnder paine of damnation, exacted of them) might have been an error; and could not have been infallible, as he exacted theyr faith ſhould be. Now all this beeing moſt true, and beeing alſo a reall propoſall of what is indeed revealed by God (which it is not when any falſe Church vſeth this argument) God can, and will concurre with this ignorant ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well as with any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to rayſe him by ſupernaturall Grace to an infallible aſſent to the truth, which he embraced moſt prudently vpon Reaſons proportionable to his capacity; which Reaſons do really make the verities which he beleeveth to be firſt evidently credible to him. His faith may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be truely infallible, though he knoweth not that it is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for this knowledge is no way neceſſary even in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as I ſhall ſay. <hi>Sect.</hi> 23. Now among our Sectaries ignorant men can never imbrace the points of faith with an infallible aſſent. For they muſt imbrace no point with ſuch an aſſent but when the Scripture, not taken according to the bare letter, but taken as interpreted tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tels them that ſuch a point is true. But I aske how it can ever be made evidently credible to them that ſuch a place of Scripture is truly interpreted in that ſenſe but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing that the greateſt Proteſtant Doctors teach that the true ſenſe cannot be found out but by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62436:141"/>
perhaps twently Rules; of which they are by them plainly tould, that they cannot obſerve divers, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iuſt now <hi>n:</hi> 4. whence it is clear they may and muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of finding amongſt you any true grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fitt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an infallible aſſent. This your own prime Doctors did eaſily ſee, and knew not how to deny. Hence <hi>Whitak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er de Sacra Scriptura Q.</hi> 5. <hi>C.</hi> 9. <hi>Eightly becauſe the vnskilfull know not rightly to vſe theſe meanes</hi> (of conſulting the Hebrew and Greek Originals) <hi>they muſt go to thoſe who are more skilfull:</hi> So he. And your great Devine <hi>Baronus in Apodixi P.</hi> 47. <hi>The vnlearned Laymen cannot have a certain and explicit and diſtinct knowledge of the Scriptures, and of the doctrine conteyned in the Scriptures, or that the Tranſlated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agreeth with the Originall edition.

Why then know evidently that your beleefe, amongſt Proteſtants, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſe to be infallible, nor ſo much as evidently credible, <hi>even</hi> to the ignorant; For they are ſure that, as your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſay, ſuch and ſuch Proteſtant Doctrine is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them deduced out of the word of God; ſo they are ſure that a farre greater and learnedes number of the preſent age, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all the whole numberles number of thoſe who lived theſe laſt tenne ages before your Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were men moſt vertuous and moſt learned, did

vnanimouſly affirme the quite contrary doctrine to be conformable to Scripture rightly vnderſtood. And this they know by your own confeſſion: For you never deny that Popiſh doctrine was the currant doctrine of all Chriſtians theſe laſt thouſand yeares, excepting only ſuch Chriſtians as were notorious Heretikes, or ſome few others who make no number at all fitt to appear in the viewe of ſo many millions of millions as theſe ordinary Lay-men know to have moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly imbraced the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faith; and, with a vaſt multitude of Bookes, to have moſt learnedly mainteyned, the doctrine flatly contrary to yours, to be the more conformable to Scripture; in which they lived with farre more ſanctity them now you do: why then ſhould I now forſake that, which is alſo confirmed (as you acknowledge) by many great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; and choſe to venture my Soul with theſe new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, whom I and every ignorant man knowes to go to a Church every ſunday, the very Walls of which Church be many yeares elder then theyr Religion: If they will go with vs the ould beaten way, trodden by all Antiquity, and chalked out by an vninterrupted Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Apoſtles dayes to theſe, they (as ignorant as they are) may, as I ſaid, eaſily come to ſee, Firſt that, they ſhall have as ſure grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for all their whole beleefe, as all true beleevers had the firſt two thowſand yeares before the firſt Scripture was written. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, they ſhall ſee they have as ſure a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as all true believers (the Iewes at the moſt excepted) had for thoſe two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before other Nations had the Scripture. Thirdly they ſhal ſee that they have as ſure grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to have had the firſt ſeventy yeares before the New Teſtament was finiſhed, and divulged. Fourthly they ſhall
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62436:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſee they have as ſure ground as thoſe many Nations had, who beleeved all that other Chriſtians did, and beleeved it with as true a divine faith; though they never did ſee Scripture: as I ſaid eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now out of the moſt ancient Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>S. Irenaeus.</hi> So that they ſee that the ground of theyr beliefe hath been a moſt ſure ground of true divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible faith for above more then four thouſand yeares, to witt, a good way down-ward after <hi>Chriſts</hi> time. Fiftly, they ſee alſo that the laſt thouſand yeares, which was iuſt before your Reformation, all thoſe vaſt multitudes, whom you confeſſe to have followed Popery, to have ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on the ſame ground relying on the preſent Church as infallible; Therefore from <hi>Chriſts</hi> time to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they ſee only a wonderfull ſhort ſpace of yeares, in which ſpace you ſay all refuſed to rely in theyr beleefe vpon the Church: What is this ſpace to be compared to that almoſt whole ſpace of time which was from the beginning of the World to this Reformation: in all which vaſt ſpace all faith of all men relyed on the Church as infallible. Again (as ſimple as I am) I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this evident argument, that in the thouſand yeares iuſt before your Reformation there were many Councels, many learned, and many very holy men (for they ſay that then men generally rather lived better then now) Now theſe Councels, theſe great numbers of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Holy men could not but ſee the truth of thoſe matters which are clearly and plainly ſet down in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And even the Proteſtants themſelves teach that all neceſſary matters are clearly and plainly ſet down in Scripture: I therefore neither have charity nor witt, if I ſay that they then could not ſee the truth, ſo manifeſtly clear in ſuch points; wherefore vpon good reaſon in thoſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:62436:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
points I will agree with the Roman Catholicks: But now for thoſe points which are not clear in Scripture, I will alſo not diſagree from them; becauſe, in things confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-not clear, you are likelyer to misvnderſtand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then they: And they (beſides Scripture) give mee that excellent ſure ground of the Tradition of the Church, which hath been a ſure ground for ſo many thouſand yeares; and queſtionles is a ſurer ground then truſting you; I will then, in theſe points, truſt them, and not you. And ſo you ſee why I reſolve in all points to truſt the Church. But all this is ſpoaken by the way: now let vs go on.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. My fifth Reaſon for the infallibility of ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Church ſufficient to ground divine faith, and yet differing from Scripture, is this: God hath given vs ſome meanes ſufficient to come to the faith neceſſary to Salvation (as hath been proved <hi>Queſt:</hi> 1.) But this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is not the Scripture (as I have ſhewed in the twelve firſt Sections;) Neither is it naturall Reaſon (as I ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 13:) Therefore the meanes which now actually is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs by God, is the infallible direction of the Church; there beeing not the leaſt appearance of probability for any other meanes which God hath given vs, though he might have given vs other meanes, if he had pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="9">9, My Sixt Reaſon is that, Whatſoever was held by the vniverſall Church, was, without farther queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, held for true; and the contrary to it was ever rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an errour: two manifeſt Signes of infallibility; both which will appear ſufficiently proved, when I ſhall come to cite the Fathers authority for the infallibility of the Church. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20:21:22: and you know already <hi>S.

My Seuenth Reaſon is that, without the Church be provided of ſome other infallible meanes to direct vs to the truth, beſides Scripture; there will never be any Vnity and agreement in the Church, in neceſſary points of Religion.

and conſequently to have that faith <hi>without which it is impoſsible to pleaſe God:</hi> But all ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> never be brought to agree in this one thing (that all and every one of them interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giueth an infallible aſſent to all ſuch points, as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be beleeued for atteyning Salvation) without all and every one ſubmitt theyr aſſent to ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule beſides Scripture; for ſubmitting to Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re only doth not produce this vnion, as ſo long and ſo lamentable experience hath taught vs: Neither can the Scripture alone ſuffice for this end, beeing it doth not ſo much as conteyne 24. of ſuch points as are all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation; Therefore all can never be brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in that one thing (in which vnder pain of damnation they muſt agree) without they all and every one interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give an infallible aſſent to ſome other Rule of faith then the Scripture: No other, with any appearance of reaſon, can be thought of, but the direction of the Church; Therefore her direction is this Rule. But if her direction be this Rule, her direction muſt needs be infallible; and this for two very manifeſt Reaſons. The firſt is, that it is impoſſible all ſhould be (as they are) bound vnder pain of damnation to follow this Rule, if this Rule could guide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into errour: Becauſe it is impoſſible God ſhould da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne men, for not following ſo foule an errour as this is, which makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> father as many lyes vpon God as they beleeue errours to be divine verities. The Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſon is becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe all (as I ſaid) are bound interiorly to give an infallible aſſent to all ſuch points as are propoſed by the Church: But it is impoſſible to give an infallible aſſent, grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which is not infallible (as it is clear:) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that the ground, vpon which theyr beleefe in theſe points muſt rely, is only the meer direction of the

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:62436:145"/>
by ſuch traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as vniverſally go currant in her, and are moſt notoriouſly known, not only to be permitted, but alſo to be on all occaſions vnanimouſly taught by her Prelates; and partly by ſuch definitions, and Decrees, as the Prelates of the Church, lawfully aſſembled by order of, and togeather with theyr head, do ſet forth; of which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of government wee ſhall ſpeak in the next Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. 2. Wee then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly affirme, the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood is our infallible Iudge in all our controverſies of faith, and appointed by God to be ſo. The proofe of this is eaſily and demonſtratively performed, ſuppoſing the truth of all that hath been ſaid and proved in the laſt Queſtion; in which, both out of the ould and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have brought moſt convincing teſtimonies, to prove that God hath appointed ſome Church vpon Earth to be our infallible Iudge. The ſame I proved by Severall reaſons in the laſt Section. So that wee doe not, without full proofe, ſuppoſe that God hath appointed ſome Church vpon Earth to be our infallible Iudge. This then (vpon good proofe) ſuppoſed; wee eaſily demonſtrate this Church appointed by God for our Iudge, to be the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and only the Roman Church: wee do it thus. The Proteſtant Church, and all other Churches different from the Roman, do iudge, do declare, and profeſſe them ſelves to be fallible, even according to the infallible word of God: If then the Proteſtant Church, or any other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches different from the Roman, be infallible in all that they iudge, and in that they declare and profeſſe to be true even according to the word of God, they doubtles are then infallible, and ſpeak then the infallible truth, when they iudge and declare and profeſſe, that even according to the word of God, they are fallible: Therefore infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:62436:146"/>
they are fallible. Hence again, it beeing thus proved that no Church different from the Roman is infallible: and it beeing formerly proved that God hath appointed ſome Church vpon Earth to be our infallible Iudge: it demonſtratively followeth, that the Roman Church muſt needs be this infallible Iudge; becauſe no Church diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Roman (that is, none but the Roman) can be this infallible Church; as my former argument proved. Some of our adverſaries are pleaſed fondly to miſtake this argument, as if wee argued thus; The Roman Church claymeth infallibility: Therefore ſhee muſt needs have right to it. This argument wee give our adverſaries free leave to ſcoff at, as much as they pleaſe; it is nothing like ours: wee put all the force of our argument in this; that the Church, truly appointed by God for infallible Iudge of Controverſies, cannot poſſibly be any of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which teach them ſelves not to be this infallible iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; becauſe they teach them ſelves to be fallible. If then they be infallible in the doctrine they teach, they are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible when they teach them ſelves to be fallible: Whence it followeth that infallibly they are fallible. The Church which is truly appointed by God to be infallible Iudge, muſt needs have this condition; that ſhee doth own her infallibility: but this is farre from ſaying; that meerly the ownning of infallibility doth make infallibility her own. It is a very different thing to ſay, <hi>he that muſt be a Miniſter, muſt needs be a man, and not a Woman:</hi> and to ſay, <hi>that ſuch an one muſt needs be a Miniſter becauſe he is a Man, and not a Woman:</hi> ſo it is one thing to ſay, the Church which is the infallible Iudge, muſt be a Church iudging, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d houlding, and profeſſing her ſelfe to be infallible; and cannot be a Church which iudgeth and profeſſeth her ſelfe to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible:

If you will not yield to the Pope defining ioyntly with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62436:147"/>
wee are ſure enough that you will neither yield to Pope alone, nor Councel alone. If God hath provided vs of one way, which is a ſure and infallible way to know any neceſſary point of faith, and to keep vs all in ſetled vnity, concerning all matters declared by this infallible authority (ſuch as wee all hould this Authority to be:) it is impoſſible that wee ſhould want neceſſary direction, or a ſufficient meanes to maintaine that vnity which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Church, or that guidance which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our Salvation.

The infallibility of the Church, thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is a point of Catholik faith: the other be opinions of Catholik Devines, all who agree in the exacting the

And it cannot ſeeme ſtrange to any Chriſtian that the ſame God, who gave an infallible aſſiſtance to <hi>Salomon</hi> (who proved an Idolater) that the Church might enjoy the benefitt of his Bookes, ſhould give either the ſupreme Paſtour of the Church, or the Church Repreſentative, for that particular time, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance, that all the Church might enjoy ſo great a benefitt as is the ſecure direction in all points of faith, and the perpetuall preſervation in vnity of faith, not to be had ſufficiently by any other meanes that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vnto vs. Yea, who can chooſe but think it ſtrange, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the ſecure direction of all the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans converted only in the Apoſtles dayes, ſhould give this infallibility to all, and every one of the Apoſtles; and that he ſhould regard ſo litle the ſecure directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Chriſtians, who were to be converted after the Apoſtles times to the very end of the world, that for theyr ſakes, and for the ſecure direction of theyr Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and theyr preſervation in vnity of faith, he would not give this infallibility ſo much as to one only man?

                  <p n="3">3. Having now, by all ſaid in the former diſcourſes, proued that the Church diffuſed, or vniverſall, was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God with ſome infallible meanes, beſides Scripture, to direct all ſecurely in faith, and to preſerue them in vnity, by the true deciſion of all theyr Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: wee haue found already enough to perſwade any prudent Man, to ſeek after the particular manner by which this meanes is to be appliable, and ſerviceable vnto him.

This Repreſentative, and theyr Decrees, be called the Decrees of the Kingdome.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:62436:148"/>
for the making the Decrees. And though Children and woemen belong to the Church; yet all eaſily ſee, that the Church government belongs not to them: neither is theyr Vote (in any mans opinion) required for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Controverſies in Faith: Wee ſay alſo, that the Laity hath no deciſive voice in this point: they be ſheepe, and not Paſtours.

When thou ſhalt have read but this ſmall part of authorities for the infallibility of the Church repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or aſſembled in a genetall Councel, thou wilt ſtand aſtoniſhed to read in ſome of our adverſaries, that there is no mention at all in antiquity of the infallibility of the Church; For thou ſeeſt here firſt how Councels are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpoſely to end all controverſies in faith, by defining
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:62436:150"/>
what is to be beleeved by all; that is, what is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly held as a divine truth revealed by God. All the Fathers, who aſſembled to define this, did aſſume an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable authority to theyr aſſembly to do this: vpon this authority they paſſed theyr votes, in order to make a definition of what was to be propoſed to all men living then, and ever to live in the Church hereafter; even curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and excommunicating all who ſhould at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve contrary to what they defined: which had been a moſt Sacrilegious, and impious, and a moſt vniuſt and tyranicall act, and the moſt deſtructive to the Church that could be invented, if, by ſo great an authority, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent were given, and a wide gappe opened to preſſe errours, vpon all the world preſent and to come, to be beleeved as divine verities revealed by God. The moſt bloody perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of tyrants could never have been halfe ſo pernicious to the Church, as would have been to be compelled by generall Councels (that is by the Vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of Chriſtendome) to imbrace that as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Verity, which is, in reall truth, a lye fathered vpon God. Surely a practice ſo vniverſall, ſo frequent, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, ſo notoriouſly publike, would have been cryed out vpon over and over again by the moſt Zealous, and moſt learned ancient Fathers; who notwithſtanding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opened theyr mouthes againſt this proceeding of Councels: For thoſe proceedings could not be iuſtifiable, though thoſe Councels had defined nothing but truth at the preſent: but ſo, that they had beene lyable to define falſity; Becauſe thus they did ſetle for ever a Court, which by way of courſe ſhould perpetually be called and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for the definition of matters of greateſt moment, which definitions, vnder paine of excommunication were
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:62436:151"/>
to be ſubmitted vnto by all the world: Now if theſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitons could be errours, this was nothing els but to take the ſureſt courſe they could invent, to circumvent all ages into incurable errours. And yet this was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the pureſt antiquity; And this courſe they held the beſt to preſerve purity of faith. And, as you have ſeen, the moſt holy Fathers reverenced with higheſt reſpect all the General Councels, which had paſſed before, or in theyr dayes; leaving vs example to ſhew the like reſpect to all which have paſſed, or may paſſe in our dayes. For the authority given by God is equally given to other as lawfull Councels: to witt, the infallible authority of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging right by the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, ſo often inſiſted vpon by the Fathers now cited. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is that, if you read hiſtories of all ages, you ſhall never meet with any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (held for Catholike) who ever opened his mouth, I do not ſay to cry down, but even in the leaſt degree to call in queſtion the truth of any thing which he knew to be defined by a lawfull generall Councel. <hi>What bouldnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it, after the authority of ſo great a Councel, that they make new diſputations a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d queſtions?</hi> ſayth <hi>S.

But, as it is ſayd in the Epiſtle of Iulius ad Diaconum Flaccillum &amp;c. regiſtred in <hi>S.

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:62436:151"/>
who, after the Iudgment paſſed by ſo many Prieſts, reſerueth any thing to be handled further by his own private Iudgement.</hi> And yet you will preſume to reſerve the finall Review, and the approving or reproving all the Definitions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, by your private Iudgment of diſcretion, if that lead you to conceave that you have clear Scripture on your ſide. He was the cheefe Biſhop of the Church, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided by his Legates in the Councel of Chalcedon, who writt theſe following Words to the Emperour; (<hi>Leo Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Ep:</hi> 78. <hi>ad Leonem Auguſtum, C.</hi> 3.) <hi>Concerning the affayers which have been defined at Nice, and at Chalcedon, wee dare not vndertake a new treaty, queſtioning again thoſe things, as if they were either doubtfull or of weak ſtrength: which ſo great an authority by the holy Ghoſt hath ſetled.</hi> What he dared not do, any Cobler amongſt you dares venture on. But very truly ſaid Gelaſius (whom I cited in the end of the laſt number) the doing of this is the vndoing of all Councels; for <hi>No Conſtitution of the Church should be ſtable, if men ceaſe not to riſe vp againſt the Foundation of Truth;</hi> for ſo he called the definition of a generall Councel almoſt twelue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares ago. You, who make theſe definitions falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, make them no definitions; for they never put a finall end to the Controverſy, they never do terminate any point: for after theyr determinations, as if they were no determinations, you call all to your private Reuiew; and there, what you really thinke fitt, your iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (with out any iudgement and diſcretion) freely rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and disbeleeueth.</p>

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:62436:152"/>
ſhould ſitt down, and call to our examin the definitions and determinations of a generall Councell. Have wee ſuch aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt as Councels have? Have wee halfe the authority, or any thing like to the one quarter of the witt, or learning, or knowledge, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſnes which they haue? Lett, I pray, vs two rather ſitt down, and examin how true this is which I ſhall now ſay; Either the determinations of Councels in points of Faith (for of theſe I alwayes ſpeake) be ſuch as are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt clear Scripture; or els the texts, to which wee think the Councel to be contrary, be not cleare and evident to the contrary; which, if they be not, it would be a ſhameles imprudence in you and mee, to think wee ſhould ſurer hitt right vpon the meaning of obſcure texts in Scripture, then a whole generall Councel (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Authority in Chriſtendome) hath done. But now if the places alleadgeable againſt the Councels be evidently cleare, do you think to perſwade any prudent and pious man, that this evident cleernes could not be ſeen by ſo very many, and thoſe ſo very eminent for piety, and for prudence, as are known to have ſubſcribed to ſo many generall Councels; who could vſe, and are to be judged to have vſed all the beſt Rules to vnderſtand Scripture as well as wee two.

                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:62436:153"/>2. Now to ſee what the Councels on theyr part are to do; I muſt tell you, that theyr cheefe buſines is to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the points in controverſy; hearing all that occurreth for the one ſide and the other, and permitting ſeverall replies, if any remaine, in due time to be made. After this diligence is vſed, they conſider what ſeemeth moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the word of God, and every ones vote is to paſſe vpon this particular. But here I muſt tell you that by the word of God, all Councels, and Orthodox belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, have ever vnderſtood, not only Gods written word conteyned in Scripture, but alſo his vnwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word made known to the Church by only Tradition; which Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo is, and was ever, accounted by the Church the very beſt and ſureſt interpreter of the Scripture. The vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therefore of the fathers aſſembled in Councel are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, not only of what they think to be conformable to Gods word written in Scripture, but alſo how confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable ſuch a point is, or is not, to that traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they have all received from the Fathers of theyr Church, as delivered to them from theyr Fathers for Gods word, by Tradition committed to theyr Fore-fathers as ſuch, from the Apoſtles themſelves. So for example, if in a Councel there doth ariſe a queſtion, whether wee are to pray for the dead, or to adore the Sacrament, or to confeſſe our ſins to a Prieſt; the Councel aſketh the Prelates of Italy, Britany, Spain, Polonia, Greece, &amp;c, What in each one of theyr reſpectiue Nations, ſo vaſtly different from one an other, hath been the ancient prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and beliefe amongſt them? And whether at any time ſuch a point was ever ſaid to have been introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them as a novelty? Or contrary wiſe that no other beginning of that practice could be ever heard of then the firſt beginning of Chriſtian Religion? Now when by
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:62436:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the vnanimous anſwer of all the Prelates of Italy, Spain, Britany, Polonia, Greece, &amp;c, It is conſtantly aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in all theſe ſo vaſtly diſtant Nations, Prayer for the dead, Adoration of the Sacrament, Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, were ever, time out of minde, practiſed, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and noe time in any one of thoſe Nations can be found, in which this practice and beliefe was held to be introduced as a novelty; but contrary wiſe they are, and ever were (as farre as they can hear of) eſteemed to have been delivered to them, together with all the other points of Chriſtian Faith, when this Faith was firſt planted in each one of thoſe Nations. It cannot but then appeare evidently credible vnto the Councel, that theſe doctrines and practices are Apoſtolicall; whence accordingly they paſſe theyr votes to define them. So that when theyr vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are paſt and gathered, <hi>This only, and nothing but this, the Catholike Church doth do by the decrees of her Councels; that what before they had received by only Tradition from theyr Anceſtours, that no they leaue conſigned in authenticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to all poſterity.</hi> Theſe be the very words of <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis</hi> advers: Hereſes: neither could I deviſe any fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you aske, why the Church or Councels eſteeme ſo much tradition? I anſwer <hi>firſt,</hi> Becauſe in prudence, and piety, they cannot but eſteeme as much Gods vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, as his written; ſeeing that the word of a true honeſt Man, is as much to be eſteemed true, when it is only delivered by word of Mouth, as when it is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by writing. Your Miniſters vſually ſo confound the buſines, that they make theyr Auditors even to ſtartle, when they tell them, that wee hould Tradition equall to Scripture; becauſe firſt, they have deeply imprinted in
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:62436:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theyr minds, that Tradition is nothing but an ould tale ſet on foote by I know not whom: But if they meant to deale really, they ſhould ſay what the Truth is; that wee do indeed equalize Tradition to Scripture, and that wee haue all reaſon to do ſo. Why? What is Scripture? Gods word written. What is Tradition? The ſame Gods word notified, not by writing, but by the full report of the Catholik Church, I pray now, how do wee wrong God, when wee ſay of his word, what wee ſay of the word of one, whom wee moſt commend for Truth, that his word only ſpoaken, and not written, is as ſure, or true (and conſequently as much to be eſteemed, and credited) as any word of his that is written even with his own hand. Nay, I pray mark how you wrong God, who ſlight Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is nothing but the word of God vnwritten. What wrong is it to an honeſt man, to ſlight all he ſayth vnleſſe he confirmes it by writing? I know the beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you have to juſtify your ſelves is, That Scripture is aſſueredly known to vs to be Gods owne word: But as for our Traditions, you do not know, nor cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God doth owne them for his own word. But giue me leaue to aske, whence are you aſſured that the Scripture is Gods own word? Your beſt, and indeed your only, aſſurance is, that all the Chriſtian world ſayth ſo: See <hi>Sect:</hi> 20. <hi>n.</hi> 5. That then which makes you, with ſo great aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, know Gods written word, is Tradition: But the ſame Tradition, which tells vs that the Apoſtles delivered theſe points to vs as divine verities in writing; tels vs alſo, that the ſame Apoſtles delivered theſe and theſe points to vs as divine verities by word of Mouth only. If the Tradition of the Church be a Lyar in this laſt part, ſhee may as well be a lyar in the firſt part. When you
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:62436:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beleeve Scripture, you truſt to tradition, teſtifying that the Apoſtles gave ſuch and ſuch bookes to the Church of the firſt age to be beleeved as Gods word: ſee two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable places of <hi>S. Auſten</hi> preſſing this hard, which I cite preſently <hi>n:</hi> 7. Again, when you beleeve that the Copies, which wee have now of thoſe bookes, be neyther forged, nor corrupted Copies, but do truly agree with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalls given out by the Apoſtles; you again wholy truſt to the traditions of all the after Churches that have been in every age from the Apoſtles to this very prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church. For it was as much in the power of the Church, in any one of theſe ages, to have thruſt a falſe Copie into your hand, in place of a true one; as to thruſt a falſe tradition into the Mouth of every Catholik every where, in place of a true one. Admirably Tertullian (de Preſcript: <hi>C.</hi> 28.) <hi>How is it likely that ſo many and ſo great Churches should erre in one faith? Among many events there is not every where one iſſue. The errours of the Churches</hi> (had there been any in the delivering of theſe Traditions) <hi>muſt needs have varied;</hi> (for though every man ſhould agre to tell his child a lye, yet every one would not agree in telling iuſt the very ſelfe ſame lyes:) <hi>But that which amongſt many is found one, is not miſtaken, but</hi> (as a ſure Tradition) <hi>delivered: Audeat ergo aliquis dicere eos erraſſe qui tradiderunt? Dare then any man ſay that they all erred who delivered</hi> (with ſuch vniformity) <hi>This tradition?</hi> ſo he; houlding it, as you ſee, impudence to ſay this tradition could be fallible. Is not this clearly to hould the Tradition of ſo many and ſo great Churches infallible? Behould here then plain Popery in the higheſt point proved and approved with in two hundred yeares after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But more of Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioſ hereafter, <hi>S.</hi> 20. <hi>n:</hi> 4. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d much hath bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid, <hi>S.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 4. 5</p>

                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:62436:155"/>4. My task now is, to ſhew tradition doth conuey and bring down Gods word to vs as ſure, yea rather ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, by perpetuall practice, and vniforme doctrine, then by any writing. To ſhew this, I brought many ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Sect:</hi> 10. <hi>n.</hi> 13. and <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 1. 2. In both which Sections I have ſaid many things of traditions: and in the firſt place I ſolved the cheefe objections againſt them. But yet I will clear this, and one or two other doubts which trouble many. For clearing then of this doubt, let vs take two traditions, one confeſſed by you to be a true one, the other to be proved by mee to be no leſſe true then the former, becauſe it is teſtified by as good a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as the former; and therefore either the former is not proved Sufficiently by this teſtimony, or elſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is. Yet the truth is (and my argument ſhall make it good) that both of them be made as credible to be Gods word by Tradition only, as any writing by its ſole force could make them. The firſt tradition which I will, for example ſake, take, is the Baptizing of children (of which I ſpok <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. <hi>n:</hi> 3.) The Second is of praying for the dead. Of theſe two I diſcourſe to my purpoſe thus. Both theſe points (ſay I) were for divine verities and practiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Apoſtles to the primitive Church, and ſo from hand to hand came moſt vndoubtedly delivered down to vs. Hence, conformably to this tradition, every where the Chriſtians baptized theyr litle Children; every where they prayed for the faithfull departed. Nothing more common to all men then to be borne, nothing more common then to dye, for every one who is borne: hence, as the dayly cuſtome is of beeing borne, ſo the dayly cuſtome in all the Church, is to baptize thoſe who are newly borne: and as it is the dayly cuſtome for all that are
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:62436:155"/>
born to dy; ſo the dayly cuſtome was to pray for the dead. But yet prayer for the dead was, by more frequent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, teſtified in this reſpect; becauſe thoſe who are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, are baptized but once in theyr Lives: but thoſe who are dead are many times, and that for many yeares after theyr death, prayed for by name; beſides the dayly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for all the faithfull departed in general. Well now, let vs ſuppoſe that both theſe traditions be called in queſtion, whether they be faithfull deliverers of the true word of God; or rather, in place of it, deliver ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man invention; as you will ſay, Praying for the dead is; and the Anabaptiſts will ſay, that baptizing of children is. Let vs now further ſee, which of theſe two traditions cannot defend it ſelfe from forgery, as well as any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture queſtioned of beeing true Scripture: for example, the Apocalyps, or Revelation, which your Lutheran Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren hould not to be true Scripture. How will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Apocalyps? you can ſay no more then I have ſaid <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 12. for all our Canon in generall; And the tradition vpon which thoſe Councels received the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps had more contradiction, then ever prayer for the dead had. For the Apocalyps was not only rejected by the moſt ancient Heretikes, the Marcioniſts, the Alogians, The Theodotians; but alſo by divers ancient Catholiks (eſpecially the Grecians; as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> teſtifieth Epiſt: ad Dardanum:) But Prayer for the dead was contradicted by no Catholike at all: amongſt ancient Heretikes, <hi>Aërius</hi> indeed did contradict it; but this is noted in him as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Hereſy of his own invention, both by <hi>S. Auſten</hi> (whoſe words I gave you <hi>Sect:</hi> 8. fine:) and <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> Hereſy 75. ſayeth, this <hi>Aërius had an aërian wicked Spirit againſt the Church;</hi> and then he denovnceth againſt him,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:62436:156"/>
                     <hi>that prayers doe profit the dead.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Saint</hi> there ſayth, <hi>the Church doth this neceſſarily</hi> (this is his word) <hi>by The Tradition received from her Anceſtours.</hi> And he not long after (Hereſy 77.) doth profeſſe, <hi>that every man falleth into ſtrange inconveniencies, if he will but once paſse the bounds ſet him by the Holy Church, and leap over the hedges of traditions.</hi> He held therefore prayer for the dead ſutable to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church, and Tradition. And as for <hi>S. Auſten</hi> (Chap: 1. de <hi>Cura pro Mortuis agenda</hi>) He ſayth, <hi>that the vniverſall Church did shine with this cuſtome of praying for the dead at the Altar.</hi> The greateſt Doctors of the Church could not be ignorant of a Cuſtome <hi>shining in the Church,</hi> not particular, but vniverſal. And it is this <hi>shining of this Cuſtome</hi> which I preſſe, and not <hi>S. Auſtens</hi> authority, otherwiſe then as a witnes of this <hi>shining Tradition.</hi> He alſo Serm: 32. de <hi>Verbis Apoſtoli</hi> (which place Bede. 1. <hi>Thes:</hi> 4. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a thouſand yeares agoe cited out of <hi>S. Auſten</hi>) ſayth thus; <hi>By the prayers of the Holy Church, and by the wholeſome ſacrifice, and by the Almes which are given for theyr Soules, it is not to be doubted but the dead are helped: ſo that our Lord dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les more mercifully with them, then theyr Sinnes have deſerved.</hi> Why is not this to be doubted of? It followeth, <hi>Becauſe this, delivered down from our Fathers, the whole Church doth obſerve.</hi> See <hi>S Chryſ:</hi> teſtimony of this tradition in the next <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 4 And this tradition is that which I now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon, which indeed did ſhine in the practice of the primitive Church. You ſhall not find one Liturgy, or Service book, vſed in the ancient Church, which is not witnes of this tradition; though theſe bookes were found in every Pariſh of Chriſtendom in which divine Service was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dayly Said. Tertullian (who lived within leſſe then a hundred and fifty yeares after the Canon of Scripture
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:62436:156"/>
was finiſhed) doth number vp this cuſtome of prayer for the dead among the ancient traditions; De corona mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. <hi>C.</hi> 3. It is ordinary in Law (for proofe of long poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) to find witneſſes teſtifying what was done not only fifty, but alſo three or four ſcore yeares agoe: Wherefore even two or three handings of this tradition by ſuch aged hands, would reach down this practice from <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſts time to Tertullian. And it is but a ſmall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to a thing teſtified to be a tradition, to allow it three or four deſcents (can the authenticalnes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips be better proved, going vpwards to the Apoſtles, then this? I am ſure Baptiſme for Children cannot. Again, in both theſe points it is a moſt ſtrong argument (and as ſtrong for Prayer for the dead, as for the other) that no time can be named in which theſe cuſtomes began; No Man can be thought of, who could by human meanes (and ſuch meanes as ſhould not make a mighty Noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe great reverencers of tradition) draw all the world, in ſo ſhort a time after the Apoſtles, to follow cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as Apoſtolicall which then, that is, in that age in which they were firſt vented, Were evidently, by every man, not only known, but clearly ſeen to be new hatched Novelties; and not ancient and Apoſtolicall traditions. This man who broached this falſe doctrine ſhould have been putt in the Catalogues of heretikes by <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>S. Auſten:</hi> whereas they did not only not put him down for an heretikes, but they both did put down Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius for one, becauſe he taught the contrary. Now if you ſpeake of theſe Cuſtomes, going downward, vntill the Age in which they began to bee denyed by Anabaptiſts, or Proteſtants; Prayer for the dead hath come downe with ſuch a full ſtreame, that it drew all Countries in all
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:62436:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ages with it; in ſo much that every where (but among a few late borne Arminians and Albigenſes) the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice bookes in all Pariſhes of all Countries can be as ſure witneſſes of this cuſtome, as the Copies of Age after age can teſtify wee have the true Copie of the Apocalips. And ſo ould Rituals will teſtify (though not ſo fully) Baptiſme of Children, by witneſſing the Cerimonies obſerved in ſuch Baptiſmes. And, as for prayer for the dead, the very ſtones cry out in all ould monuments, for our prayers for thoſe who ly interred vnder them. The ouldeſt founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be thoſe, which our greateſt grand fathers made (as appeareth by the moſt ancient Records) for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning prayers for theyr Soules: And this not in one Country, but there is not one Country which aboundeth not with ſuch Monuments, and ſuch Records; the very ſtrongeſt proofes of aſſured antiquity and vnqueſtionable tradition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus, I hope, I have made good that, tradition ſhining in perpetuall practice in all times, and all ages, is a ſurer relator and reporter, then a teſtimony in writing; which, if ancient, muſt alſo have the prime teſtimony (witneſſing it to be vncorrupt) from tradition. And hence alſo you clearly ſee, that Scripture, true or falſe, can be no better known to be ſo then true traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from falſe: for if Tradition could be falſe in any point ſo vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally current; it might beare witnes to a falſe Scripture, and deny due approbation to many true ones.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When then wee are demanded, how wee can know a true Tradition from a falſe one? Wee anſwer, firſt; that wee can do this better then you can know true bookes, and true Copies of the true bookes of Scripture, from falſe: for, before you can do either of theſe, you muſt
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:62436:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt know true Tradition from falſe; that he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you may, not coniecturally, but aſſuredly ſay. <hi>Theſe be the true bookes of Scripture; theſe be the true Copies of theſe true Bookes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe true Tradition recommendeth them for ſuch: Theſe be falſe bookes, or falſe Copies of true bookes; becauſe the Tradition which recommendeth theſe, is falſe.</hi> Tell mee the meanes by which infallibly the true tradition in this point may be known from the falſe; and that very meanes I will aſſigne to know, in other points, true Tradition from falſe. <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew, that wee have better meanes to do this, then all the world had to know theyr true traditions from falſe, for the firſt two thowſand yeares, before the time of Moyſes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I anſwer directly, by aſſigning this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; which is, when a doubt begins to be farre ſpread in the Church concerning any tradition, to call a generall Councell, and there, by the examination inſtituted by men moſt knowing of antiquity in generall, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well verſed in the received, and approved ould cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of theyr countries. For the countries of thoſe in the Councel beeing ſo farre diſtant, and ſo wholy indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent one of an other, cannot poſſibly have all of them received, and that without any known oppoſition in any one of them, one and the very ſelfe ſame tradition, from any other hands but from thoſe, from whom they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theyr whole faith, and this particular tradition for part of it. For, had the beginers and ſowers of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now queſtioned, been after the firſt Planters of our faith, there would in ſome countrye or other, be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und out ſome author of this firſt tradition; there would bee ſome fame good, or badde, of that man who was able to perſwade a phanſy of his own, to be Apoſtolicall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and to be firmely held ſo by all the world, without
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:62436:158"/>
oppoſition in any part thereof, even though this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as you ſay of moſt of our traditions) had a direct oppoſition to the ancient doctrine of the Apoſtles. Which doctrine, when our traditions were held for Apoſtolicall, was too too freſh to be ſo ſoon forſaken, and that ſo eaſily, and ſo generally, with out any oppoſition. Now when the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graveſt Prelates fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all parts of the world aſſembled, having inſtituted an exact proceſſe of the true antiquity and vniverſality of the tradition queſtioned; and in this proceſſe found an vnanimous conſent of all kind of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from all corners of the world; it is now iuridical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and notoriouſly made evident, that ſuch a point hath come down to vs by a true tradition; and for that very reaſon is a true object of faith, beeing the word of God delivered by as faithfull a meſſenger, as the very Copies of Scripture are. And thus, when it was grown doubtfull in the Church, whether ſuch and ſuch bookes were part of the true Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scripture; the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended theſe bookes was examined in the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Carthage, in which <hi>S. Auſten</hi> was preſent, and there (as I ſhewed <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 12.) all the bookes of our Canon (ſo different from yours) were found to be recommended to the Church by a true and authenticall tradition: and therefore wee imbrace them as the word of God; Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beeing as credible a relatour of Gods word deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Apoſtles to the Church, as any writing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whence againe you need not wonder to ſee that by vs and by the Fathers cited in the next Section numb: 4. Tradition is equalized to Scripture, for this is nothing elſe but to hould that the word of God delivered by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as ſure a meſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger as any writing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is to be beleeved, as much as the word of God delivered by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:62436:158"/>
and ſuch a writing as hath no ſurer witnes of beeing Authenticall then tradition. Hence <hi>S. Auſten</hi> (de vtilit. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi C. 14.) diſputing with an Heretike, who would firſt have him to beleeve Scripture before Catholike Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, maketh the heretike ſpeak thus: <hi>Beleeeve this writing.</hi> Then he replies; <hi>But every writing if it be new and vnheard of, recommnded by a few, no other reaſon cofirmlng it; wee do not beleeve the writing, but wee beleeve thoſe who bring forth this writing: wherefore if you</hi> (Lutherans, Calviniſts, &amp;c.) <hi>bring forth this writing, you beeing ſo few and ſo vnknown</hi> (for where were you theſe laſt thouſand yeares before <hi>Luther?) I have no mind to beleeve</hi> you. Now becauſe the heretike knew not how to preſſe <hi>S. Auſten</hi> to give firſt credit to this writing or Scripture, by ſaying that all of his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid it was the word of God; without preſſing him with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all the Chriſtian world by vniverſall tradition: <hi>S. Auſten</hi> prevents him, by telling him; <hi>well you will ſend me to the multitude and fame</hi> (of Church tradition;) <hi>but I pray rather admonish mee to seeke out the cheefe leaders of this Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to ſeeke them out moſt diligently and moſt laboriouſly, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe,</hi> (governers of the churches) <hi>rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, I may learne ſome thing of theſe writings: for if theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had not been, I should never have known that there had been at all any thing to be learnt</hi> (concerning theſe Scriptures truly in my mind this, not only authority, but this moſt preſſing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> conuinceth that the Governours of this multitude of all true beleevers (eſpecially aſſembled in one Councel togeather) be the beſt guides God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vs vpon earth, both to know which is Scripture, of the true word of God written; and which Tradition, or the true word of God vnwritten: and alſo to know moſt aſſuredly, how this word of God is rightly vnderſtood.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:62436:159"/>
Wherefore preſently the ſame <hi>S. Auſten (Cap:</hi> 15.) doth admoniſh, vs for the avoiding of all errours, <hi>as the eaſieſt meanes there-vnto, willingly to obey the precepts of that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Church,</hi> precepts made by her with ſo great an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And then in his Sixteenth Chapter he clearly tells vs that, God having given vs this Authority, wee ought not to deſpaire of an infallible meanes to know the truth; becauſe this Authority is that very infallible meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by miracles, and by the miraculous multitude fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it ſo extreamly againſt all human intereſt. Thus then he diſcourſeth; <hi>For if the divine providence of God doth nor preſide in human affaires, in vain would ſollicitude be about Religion: But if both the very outward beauty of all things, and our inward Conſcience doth both publikely and priuately exhort vs to ſeeke out and ſerve God, wee are not to deſpaire that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is ſome authority appointed by the ſame God, on which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wee relying, as on an aſſured ſteppe, may be lifted vp to God. This Authority moveth vs by two wayes, partly by Miracles, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly by the multitude of its followers.</hi> Behould here an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity appointed by God, an authority, on which wee may moſt ſecurely rely, and not only not get a fall (ſlipping into errours) by leaning vpon it confidently; but an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>on which wee relying, as on an aſsured ſteppe, may be lifted vp to God,</hi> who with <hi>miracles</hi> hath confirmed this authority to be moſt ſecure. Whence preſently <hi>S. Aug:</hi> tels vs how thoſe miracles have drawn ſo great a multitude. But whether this multitude were Catholiks, or Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, you ſhall know them by theyr fruits, for they <hi>had a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance extended to faſting with bread and water, and not only dayly faſts, but faſts continued for many dayes. A Chaſtity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining the having wife or children; a patience ſleyghting croſſes and ſlames; a Liberality reaching forth to the diſtributing out to
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:62436:159"/>
the poore theyr whole patrimonies.</hi> Theſe things wee ſee ſtill dayly among Catholiks; and though, (as <hi>S. Auſten</hi> addeth) <hi>but few do theſe things, yet all people praiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, approve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> none accounted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuperſtitious in thoſe dayes. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee then ſo great hope from God, ſo great profit, and fruit, shall wee doubt to betake our ſelves to the lappe of that Church which even by the confeſsion of mankind from the Apoſtolique ſeat</hi> (ſo antiquity vſeth to call the ſeat of the Biſhop of Rome) <hi>by ſucceſsion of Bishops hath obteyned the toppe of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; heretikes in vain barking round about it, but condemned partly by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the people</hi> (vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tradito<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) <hi>partly by the gravity of Councels, partly by the maieſty of Miracles; to which church not to give the firſt place is truly a thing either of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Impiety, or of headlong Arrogancy.</hi> So he. So I. So wee all.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I have putt down the place more fully becauſe <hi>D. Ferne Sect.</hi> 30. would diſprove our Tenets by the deepe Silence of them in Antiquity, and particularly in <hi>S. Auſten,</hi> Whom I ſhall ſhew alſo preſently (<hi>Sect.</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 5.6.) in a doze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> places of his works to hould dictinctly this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church in her traditions and doctrine. Well then, ſhee beeing as infallible in delivering the vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God, as in delivering the written word; the Prelates aſſembled in her Councels have as much reaſon to rule themſelves, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theyr ſubjects by the one, as by the other. By a writing only wee never knew any Common wealth governed. By Tradition only the whole Engliſh Nation hath kept our Common Law; which was never written by the Law Makers themſelves; Yet is made no leſſe known by only Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then our ſtatute Lawes which were delivered in writing by the Law makers. But what ſpeak I of one Nation? The whole Church through the whole world was governed by Tradition only. For
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:62436:160"/>
the firſt two thouſand yeares; and then partly by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, partly by writing, it was governed for above two thowſand Yeares more; to witt, for the ſecond two thowſand yeares from Moſes vntill <hi>Chriſts</hi> time. See <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 1. Now from the preaching of <hi>Chriſt</hi> vnto the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Canon, and the diuulging of the ſame in ſuch languages as all Nations vnderſtood, very many yeares paſſed, and all the true beleevers in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church were governed by Tradition only; See <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 2. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas ſome of our adverſaries obſcurely anſwer; <hi>That the word of God was in ſubſtance before Chriſts Church,</hi> which (ſay they) was begotten by it. Wee reply clearly to them thus: When (ſay wee) You ſpeake of the word of God, which was before Scripture, and which begot the Church, you ſpeake of the vnwritten word of God; This vnwritten word is that very thing which wee call Tradition. And indeed when you ſpeake of ſuch a word, as muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for an exterior and infallible direction for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions (as were to be directed by it in the way of Salvation before the Scripture was all written, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged in ſuch languages that might make it fitt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all Nations) you muſt of neceſſity put this word of God outwardly expreſſed by ſome meanes or other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing it in ſuch a manner, as might be able to produce this effect of guiding whole Millions in the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by an infallible beleefe of all that God hath ſaid by that word. Now (I pray) find mee out any word of God, any where exiſtent before Scripture, in a manner fitt for the end I now ſpeake of, except this word be graunted to have wholy exiſted in the Orall Tradition of the Church of thoſe times. You all ſay, Gods word revealed is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of all faith. All theſe millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:62436:160"/>
in thoſe ages bad true faith; therefore they had Gods word revealed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d revealed in a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d divine faith. But they had Gods word revealed by Orall Tradition only; Therefore Gods word, revealed by orall Tradition only, is a ſufficient ground to ground divine faith; which it could not be, were it not infallible, in what it delivereth for Gods word; and what is thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (by beeing ſo delivered) is a fitt Object of divine faith, ſuch as they all had in thoſe ages.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This then is the firſt Reaſon why the Church in her Councels directs her ſelfe as well by the vnwritten, as by the written word of God, becauſe the one is as truly in it ſelfe the word of God, and as ſufficiently notified to vs to be ſo by Tradition, as the Scripture is notifyed to be ſo by writing: for which cauſe holy Fathers ſtill taught thoſe things which wee know by Tradition only, to be beleeved and held equally to thoſe things which wee know by Scripture. See <hi>Sect:</hi> 20. <hi>n.</hi> 4. A ſecond reaſon why this Church not only doth, but of neceſſity muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and governe her ſelfe not by Scripture only, but alſo by vnwritten Traditions, is becauſe Scripture only doth not deliver down vnto vs all points neceſſary for the whole Church, and all the members thereof: as I have at large ſhewed <hi>Queſt:</hi> 2. naming no fewer then four and twenty of thoſe neceſſary points. All theſe points beeing wholy neceſſary, and errours beeing no where more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerours then in points wholy neceſſary, there doth ariſe an vnavoidable neceſſity to graunt, that the firſt Church planted by the Apoſtles, received her neceſſary direction and infallible inſtruction in theſe points by Tradition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for manifeſt it is, that they at the firſt received from the Apoſtles all compleat inſtruction in neceſſary points:
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:62436:161"/>
And Again it is no leſſe manifeſt, that they received no ſuch compleat inſtruction in Scripture concerning thoſe twenty four points, for then wee ſhould be able to finde this inſtruction in Scriptures, which wee not beeing able to do, wee muſt perforce graunt that they received this inſtruction by tradition expreſſed in no kinde of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but ſuch as commanded in generall all men <hi>to hould the Traditions delivered to them.</hi> 2. Theſſ: 2. And that <hi>though an angell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven should teach the contrary or beſides what they received, they should account him Anathema,</hi> Gal: 8. And again <hi>Have thou the forme of ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d words which thou haſt heard of mee</hi> 2. Ti: 1.13. And yet again c. 2. <hi>The things which thou haſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> (he ſayth not read) <hi>of mee by many wittneſſes, theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to faithfull men which shall be fitt to teach others alſo.</hi> Now as the firſt Age received theyr neceſſary inſtruction by beeing ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to no other rule of faith in theſe neceſſary points then the Tradition of the Church, and by this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were moſt compleatly inſtructed in divine faith; ſo now this preſent Church in all points not clearely expreſſed in Scripture, and alſo in that prime point of rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scripture it ſelfe, hath recourſe to Tradition as to an infallible Rule, able to make all that it teacheth a fitt Object of divine and infallible faith.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. A third Reaſon why Councels may and ought to propoſe Tradition to themſelves for an infallible Rule of faith, is this; Becauſe that Rule muſt needs be infallible by which only wee can be aſſured what the Apoſtles both by writing, and out of writing did teach to the Church: For in theyr doctrine written and vnwritten, all things belonging to faith are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned; that therefore which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly teacheth vs this, and is alſo the only thing which teacheth vs this, muſt needs be the infallible Rule of faith:
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:62436:161"/>
But Tradition is the only thing which teacheth vs this; to witt, what the Apoſtles did teach vs both by writing and by word of mouth without writing; which this Tradition performeth by millions of true beleevers of the firſt age, all take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a part (as witneſſes vſe to be to finde out how well they all agree in theyr teſtimony) and placed in ſeverall parts in the world; Many vaſtly diſtant from one an other, and yet all delivering the ſame things to thoſe other millions, who in greater number ſucceeded them in life, and in delivering the ſame things, in the ſame manner to new millions of theyr poſterity, all conſtantly agreeing in the teſtification of the very ſelfe ſame points, all affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> delivered publickly in Churches, and greateſt aſſemblies every where all theyr country over; and that ſo very exceeding often, and by ſo very many and by ſo very divers perſons of all kind of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it is more poſſible for all men in the world to fall into a fitt of dancing iuſt for a quarter of an hower at one and the ſelfe ſame time, without ever agreeing to do ſo before hand; then it is poſſible for all theſe millions of men in ſo different places, and of ſo different iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by nature, and ſo contrary in theyr humors, inclinations and proceedings, to conſpire thus in one and the ſame ſtory conteyning ſo many particulars, without that thing had been really and notoriouſly true, which ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, taken in ſo different circumſtances, all teſtified vnanimouſly to be true. If this doth not make it evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credible that the Apoſtles taught this, I dare ſay that no miracle which God can do, without forcing our wills, can make this point evidently credible vnto vs. Neither have wee any thing elſe but this Tradition which maketh it evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly credible to vs what the Apoſtles did teach the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62436:162"/>
firſt Church by writing, and by ſuch writings, and by ſuch and ſuch things delivered only by word of Mouth. Wherefore either by ſuch a teſtimony as this, or by no teſtimony at all, wee may be induced to beleeve infallibly that the Apoſtles did teach ſuch and ſuch things by word of mouth, and alſo did write ſuch and ſuch bookes. And it is moſt prepoſterous to beleeve for this teſtimony this laſt part, and not to beleeve the firſt part; yea this is plain contradiction in him who vnderſtands what he doth: for on the one ſide he ſaith, The teſtimony of Tradition ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to make a thing a fitt Object of divine faith, ſo that vpon this teſtimony only I may build that infallible aſſent, by which I beleeve theſe and theſe bookes to have been delivered by the Apoſtles; and yct I will not beleeve that the Apoſtles delivered by word of Mouth the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of praying for the dead, of baptizing infants &amp;c, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this ſelfe ſame teſtimony of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficeth not to make a thing a fitt object of faith, to which before I ſaid it did ſuffice.

                  <p n="2">2. I will ſhew this clearly by what I have already ſhewed Antiquity to affirme concerning the infallibility of Councels, in the laſt Section but one.

As alſo when <hi>S. Athanaſius</hi> calleth this definition <hi>the word of</hi> God. Is not the like fully acknowledgment which was ſhewed there to be made by <hi>S.

The ſame is ſpoken equivalently when he ſayth again, <hi>that Chriſt did preſide inviſibly in that Councel</hi> in which the Embaſſadors of the Biſhop of Rome preſided viſibly.

                  <p n="3">3. This Tradition the Fathers acknowledge infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſeverall wayes; ſome of them I have ſufficiently inſinuated <hi>Sect:</hi> 12. where I ſhewed that the Fathers refuſed to ſtand to Scripture only, as to the only, Rule of faith, becauſe all neceſſary Principles for convincing of Heretikes could not be deduced ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly from thence: And conſequently they did hould that there was ſome other Rule of faith, conteyning thoſe principles, to witt Tradition, which could not be this other Rule of faith, nor furniſh them ſufficiently with ſuch principles, except ſhee, in delivering of them, were infallible. There alſo I ſhewed that the Fathers held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers points neceſſarily to be beleeved or practiſed, for which they profeſſed, themſelves to have no Scripture, but only Tradition: Therefore they held this to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of faith. There alſo I ſhewed that they held divers points to be damnable errors, which they know to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to no written Rule, therefore they thought is was ſufficient to hould them for damnable Hereſies,

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>S. Denis</hi> Diſciple to <hi>S. Paul</hi> C. 1. <hi>Eccl: Herarch:</hi> ſaith; <hi>Thoſe our firſt Captaines of Preeſtly function</hi> (to witt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles) <hi>did deliver to vs the cheefeſt and ſuperſubſtantiall points
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62436:164"/>
partly in written, partly in vnwritten inſtitutions.</hi> So that, part of the cheefeſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently part of the neceſſary and fundamentall points, were delivered to vs in vnwritten Traditions only. If therefore this Tradition be only a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Rule, wee have no infallible Rule to rely vpon in all points neceſſary; becauſe <hi>part of them</hi> muſt rely vpon vnwritten Traditions only. <hi>S. Iuſtin</hi> in the end of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Apology for the Chriſtians, among theſe vnwritten Traditions placeth ſome things made neceſſary by Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicall precepts; <hi>As the conſecrating of Wine mingled with water; and that is is lawfull to no body</hi> (though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite for his Sinns) <hi>to receave the Euchariſt before baptiſme.</hi> Is not this neceſſary? and yet what Scripture have you for it and where find you in clear Scripture that the Apoſtles were baptized before they communicated in the laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord? There followeth the Authority of <hi>S. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> which I have ſhewed to reach ſo home, that the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le faith of whole Nations may be divine, and infallible by relying only vpon traditions, even long after the finiſhing of the Canon of Scripture <hi>S.

Doctor</hi> is that, which is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, <hi>worthy of the ſame faith</hi> which that which is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is worthy of? He held then Tradition as infallible as Scripture; of which I have given you a clear reaſon <hi>Sect:</hi> 9. <hi>num:</hi> 3. <hi>Theophilact</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> vpon the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of <hi>S.

And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> recounts how angry <hi>Brentius</hi> is whith him for ſaying; <hi>that it is by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tradition known to be vnlawfull to marry after a vow of Virginity.</hi> It is neceſſary to avoid, that which is damnable.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62436:165"/>
Wherefore to all who have made ſuch vowes, the kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wledge of this point is neceſſary Tradition therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth ſome neceſſary points: Heare <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> his words (Hereſy. 61.) <hi>It behoueth vs alſo to vſe tradition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things cannot be had out of Scripture. The Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſome things in writings, ſome things by Tradition; As S. Paul ſayth, according as I have delivered vnto you.</hi> And in an other place. <hi>So I teach, ſo I have delivered to the Churches. The Holy Apoſtles of God then have delivered that it is a Sinne to marry after Virginity decreed;</hi> to witt, by vow. Beſides what I have cited out of Turtullian already, he is much to be inſiſted vpon in his Book de Preſcrip: where C. 19. he very diſtinctly notes; that firſt of all, before ever you enter into diſpute with Heretikes out of the Scripture, you muſt diſpute theſe following points: <hi>From whom, by whom, when and to whom that diſcipline was delivered by which wee were made Chriſtians? and there aſſuredly will be found the truth of Scriptures the truth of theyr interpretation, and the truth of all Chriſtian Traditions.</hi> Marke here how the firſt ground, vpon which wee are to ſtand, as vpon a ground moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for gaining the victory againſt error, and purchaſing triumph to truth, is Tradition; For by that alone, and no poſſible way but by that, wee aſſuredly know <hi>from whom</hi> (to witt from <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſending his Apoſtles) <hi>by whom</hi> (to witt by the Apoſtles) <hi>When</hi> (in the time of theyr preaching) <hi>to whom</hi> (to witt to the Churches foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them) <hi>this diſcipline by which wee were made Chriſtians was delivered.</hi> From the Tradition then of theſe Churches as yov take the letter of Scripture, wee take alſo the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le and interpretation of it conſerved in the dayly anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice firſt inſtituted by thoſe Apoſtles, and thence by Tradition (as ſurely as by any writing) delivered down
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:62436:165"/>
by ſucceſſive practice of all ſuch Churches; to which Churches Tertullian, in his next words, diſtinctly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him ſelfe to ſend vs, for the foreſaid end. And thus all things beeing driven to theyr firſt Source and Origin) will be diſcovered that only Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is in which all the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Myſteries of our faith are conteyned; vpon this ground, ſaith he, <hi>I will preſcribe, That what the Apoſtles have preached ought nor to be proved any other way but by thoſe Churches, which the Apoſtles them ſelves have founded either by preaching to them by word of mouth, or by Epiſtle. And if this be ſo, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that all doctrine, agreeing with the doctrine of theſe Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicall and Mother Churches, is ſutable to truth, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced without all doubt</hi> (ſo infallible doth this Tradition make it.) And thus Tertullian goeth on ſtill preſſing his adverſary, independently of all Scripture, meerly by the tradition of this preſent Church, ſhewing her pedegree from the primitive Church: And this way, and only this way, he preſcribeth that wee ought to ſhew what <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught. And in the beginning of his Book de <hi>Corona Militis,</hi> his doctrine comes very home in many things to our purpoſe; As firſt, when a queſtion is asked, why wee in this Church (whoſe pedegree wee can draw from the Apoſtles) do pray for the dead? pray to Saincts? worſhip the Euchariſt &amp;c, the very asking of this Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>why do you do it?</hi> proueth that wee do it. And becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe wee every where do it in the Church, the obſervation of theſe practiſes is to ſtand good, becauſe, wee are <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentes obſervationem inveteratam quae praeveniendo, ſtatum fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. Hanc ſi nulla Scriptura determinavit, certe conſuetudo robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit; quae ſine dubio &amp;c. wee have an obſervation which by prevention, having got along ſtanding preſcription, hath ſetled it ſelfe. And though no Scripture hath determinately appointed
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62436:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this obſervance, yet cuſtome hath given it ſtrength: which cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me without all doubt came from Tradition; For how can a thing be in practice</hi> (ſo vniverſally) <hi>if it were not at firſt delivered by Tradition?</hi> Now if you ſay, that even for ſuch practiſes, delivered by Tradition, the Sripture muſt be alledged, all his whole following diſcourſe is framed againſt this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and he muſtereth vp a number of things, then obſerved by the Church (that is in the firſt two hundered yeares) without any proofe of Scripture, by the meer and ſole title of Tradition. Thus much is very home <hi>M. Doctor;</hi> as alſo that among thoſe moſt primitive obſeuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he placeth, <hi>Offering for the dead,</hi> and the even <hi>wearing out our forehead with making the Signe of the Croſſe at all kind of works wee begin:</hi> And though a man may be ſaved who doth not practice theſe things, yet they beeing Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inſtitutions, how can a man be ſaved who contemnes them? <hi>It was not in vain</hi> ſayth <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> hom: in Ep: ad Philip: and again hom: 69. ad populum. <hi>It was not in vaine decreed by the Apoſtles, That in the celebration of thoſe moſt dreadfull Myſteries, memory should be made of thoſe who are dead: They knew well that much benefitt and profitt did hence redound vnto them.</hi> See if you be ſafe who condemne that for ſuperſtitious, which the Apoſtles decreed as moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to the Soules; of which I have ſpoaken more <hi>Se:</hi> 19. <hi>n:</hi> 4.

And on the other ſide all thoſe manifold authorities, by which infallibility of Councels and Traditions have been already confirmed by mee, do alſo confirme this generall propoſition. <hi>That the Church is infallible:</hi> that is, the Church as well vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, ſpeaking by Tradition; as Repreſentative, ſpeaking by a Generall Councel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of this infallibility in generall thus <hi>S.

This Church alſo had interiourly departed from what ſhee received, ſhe had played the Miſtriſſe of miſrule and not been the Rule and ſquare of Truth, laſtly ſhee had not been without moſt hideous ſpotts, and farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deformities then wrinckles. See how you have pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her out above in my <hi>Sect:</hi> 15. <hi>n.</hi> 8. How differently <hi>S. Ireueus, Lib.</hi> 3.

How was this Spirit of truth in a Church impoſing lyes (as you ſay) for divine verities and exacting of all, vnder paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, to ſubmit to her proceedings here in? And yet you can finde <hi>Chriſt</hi> no better Church for the laſt thouſand yeares. There be four Fathers for whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies divers of our adverſaries vſe to call, in ſo much that they account theyr deepe ſilence our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, becauſe thoſe Fathers have treated expreſly againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and vndertaken how to direct others in the true faith; and therefore doubtles, had they eſteemed the Church to have been infallible they would have made her direction the firſt Rule of all. The firſt of theſe Fathers is <hi>Vicentius Lerinenſis,</hi> whom I have already ſheved at large
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:62436:168"/>
to ſtand mainly vpon this direction. See his words cited <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. As for the ſecond, who is <hi>Tertullian</hi> he lived befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the Church had or could have any generall Councell, by reaſon of the vniverſall perſecution vnder thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Emperours: and ſo Tertullian doth not indeed ſpeak of the Church repreſentative in Councels; Yet he ſpeakes home of the infallibility of the Church vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, declaring her doctrine by her Tradition, and her practice conformable to her Tradition and in all thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Tertullian</hi> houlds her infallible; as I have already ſhewed the laſt <hi>Sect: n:</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Father is <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> who how clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſpeaketh of the infallibility of the Church in her Traditions, wee have ſeen in the ſame number: I add here further an admirable ſaying of this father of the Churches infallibility: for having ſhewed Hereſy. 49. how all Hereſies ſeek to go by new found by waies, he calleth the following of the Church <hi>that kings high way of which Moſes ſpoake</hi> (Myſtically by the King of Edom) ſaying; <hi>that he would paſſe by that right on to the Land of Promiſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declining at the right hand nor the left, neither on this ſide not on that, but wee will go on ſtreight in the Kings high way. For the Kings high way is the Holy Church of God, the Roade of Truth. But every one of theſe Hereſies leaving this Kings high way decline either on the right hand or on the left to errour. But you O ſervants of God, you Sonnes of the Church of God, who have known the ſure Rule, and do go on in the way of truth, goe on clearfully, and be not called back by theyr words and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, for theyr wayes be erroneous.</hi> So he Here you have, that all Hereſies agree in this, that they leave the infallible direction of the Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d become Heretikes by choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing out wayes on theyr own head, erroneous waies,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:62436:169"/>
which in the Church never could have been mett with all, <hi>shee beeing the Kings high way, the beaten Roade of Truth, the ſure Rule, the way of truth.</hi> What more clear? To take the Churches direction as infallible, is the very bane of Chriſtendome with <hi>Doctor Ferne;</hi> with others it is the moſt intolerable errour in Popery, making all the errours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable: and yet this ancient holy Father who (as <hi>S. Auſten</hi> in his Book of Hereſies ſaith) is the moſt learned man that had written of Hereſies reprehendeth all and every one of theſe Hereſies, for erring, by refuſing to follow the Church, as <hi>a ſure Rule,</hi> and as <hi>the Kings high-way,</hi> and as <hi>a known Road of truth.</hi> Now if your cenſuring the Church for teaching her ſelfe to be this ſure Rule and plaine high way of Truth, were iuſt, <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> did him ſelfe erre moſt miſſerably, in imputing the deniall of this to them all as an errour, of which every one of thoſe Hereſies ſtood guilty. It is therefore moſt falſe which a certain <hi>vniverſity man</hi> (of whom I ſhall ſpeak more in the next Chapter) over raſhly affirmeth, that neither <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> nor <hi>S. Auſten</hi> in theyr Catalogues of Heretikes, branded any one as guilty for gainſaying this infallible guidance of the Church. For you ſee <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> brands all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with this foule marke, ſaying; <hi>That every of theſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies leaving this Kings high way</hi> (of the Church the ſure Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and plain Roade of Truth) <hi>declines eyther on the right hand, or on the left.</hi> And the ſame Father ending his Bookes of Hereſies ſayth, <hi>theſe be the young wenches</hi>) ſo he readeth that place of the Canticles <hi>Cap:</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) <hi>which are ſaid to be without number: and then</hi> to the Church he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the next verſe, <hi>My Dove, my vndefiled is but one, One is this Virgin, this chaſte one, this ſpouſe, the holy citty of God, the faith, the foundation of truth the firme Rock againſt which
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:62436:169"/>
the gates of Hell shall not prevaile.</hi> And then going to give an abridgement of the faith of the Catholike Church, he exults in the beginning, that he is now to have nothing to do with filthy Hereſies, but hath made his approach <hi>to the Calme Coaſts of Truth,</hi> to witt, the doctrine of the Church And mark how ſecure from errours he thinks him ſelfe here; <hi>for now</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>beeing free of all feare and trouble and tediouſnes, and beeing in an excellent poſture by reaſon of the firme tranquillity and ſecurity here breathing, how did wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſe in ſpirit beeing receaved in a Serene Haven?

the groſſe errours among Gentiles and Heretikes, that theyr faith was like the Concubines, which have no ſuch dowry from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he returneth to declare in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points the faith of this Chaſte Virgin the Church, in which nevertheles he ſpendeth but a leafe and a halfe according to my Booke. This I note becauſe <hi>D. Ferne Sect:</hi> 30. wonders that in a Book of this ſubject there ſhould be no more mention of Popiſh doctrines, had they been the doctrines of Antiquity. I think this Doctor never ſo much as reade that book, for if he had, he ſhould have found that he ſpeaketh of no one point of any true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith at all, vntill, he cometh to theſe three laſt leaues except it be of the admirable prayſes of the Church and of her infallibility, or moſt ſafe certain, and ſecure direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which is the prime point of Popiſh doctrine. But who ſoever ſhall come to anſwer that place of <hi>D. Ferne,</hi> will tell him how many other Popiſh points make vp the other leafe and leafe following: all which points are put down by <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> as Traditions neceſſary to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered here by him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> was moſt wrongfully accuſed by that vniverſity man of ſilence, concerning this point of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility (which he ſo much extolleth, where as he ſhould have putt it for one of the Hereſies if he had been one of your Religion:) ſo alſo is <hi>S. Auſten</hi> no leſſe wronged, who is the fourth Father whoſe ſilence of this infallibility they object; And firſt ſay they, he calleth no man Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike for denying of it, whereas all Heretikes mentioned by him in his bookes of Hereſy, could not but deny it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to vs, or els they had not been Heretikes. A ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge argument you ſay, becauſe, all Heretickes denyed this; therefore he ſhould have at leaſt noted this in ſome one
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:62436:170"/>
of them. I contrariwiſe ſay, becauſe every one of theſe Heretickes denyed this therefore it had been ridiculous to expreſſe it concerning any one of them as if he had been ſingular in that one which is comon to all, and every one (for example Were it not ridiculous in the Catalogue of Canonicall Bookes, put down in the front of the Bible, to ſay of ſome particular Bookes, for example, of the book <hi>Liviticus</hi> or the book of Iudges) <hi>this book is the true word of God.</hi> And would not ſuch an addition, make men think, that the beeing the true word of God, was leſſe common to other bookes, or that there were ſome ſpeciall doubt of theſe two bookes. Iuſt ſo it would be ridiculous to ſay ſuch Heretikes held the Church fallible, a thing common to all Heretikes. Therefore you ſee <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> when he was ſpeaking of any particular Hereſy, did not ſay, what he ſaid of that particular Hereſy, but he ſayd <hi>Every one of theſe Hereſies do this;</hi> there never beeing any ſpeciall doubt concerning any one ſingle Hereſy, whether it did doe that or no, which all Hereſies, muſt needs do; In ſo much that to giue you a Catalogue of Hertickes, is the ſelfe ſame thing that it is to give vp a Liſt of ſuch men, who, teaching a doctrin, differing from the Church to be true; muſt needs teach her doctrine to be falſe: and conſequently that ſhee did erre, and is fallible; and therefore a Iudge not to be ſubmitted vnto in thoſe her errours. Neither did <hi>S. Auſten</hi> omitt to note this, if you omitt not to note well what he ſayth. Firſt in the beginning, He puts down the Epiſtle of <hi>Quod vult Deus</hi> intreating him to write this booke <hi>that he might know what Hereſies there have been? what they did hould contrary to the Catholike Church? And alſo what on the contrary the Catholike Church hath declared againſt them?</hi> Theſe two queſtions <hi>S. Auſten</hi> taketh ſpeciall
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:62436:171"/>
notice of in his Preface to his book, repeating them in the words in which they were propoſed by <hi>Quod vult Deur.</hi> And then he begins to ſatisfy his firſt queſtion by telling him what every Hereſy hath held contrary to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. Do you not here ſee how, on all ſides, it is ſuppoſed that every hereſy held ſome thing to be true which the Church held to be falſe, and that therefore every Hereſy muſt needs teach that the Church is guilty of errours, and beeing miſtris of errours cannot be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in deciding all points truly. A litle skill <hi>in Aequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus</hi> (to which thoſe arrive who have paſſed the brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge) would have made an vniverſity man ſee a thing ſo clear. Eſpecially beeing the ſecond Queſtion maketh the firſt yet more clear, by acknowledging that it is the part of the Church to declare her meaning againſt heretickes, which is to acknowledge her the Iudge in theſe matters: for this queſtion was to know <hi>quid contra teneat Eccleſia quantum inſtructioni ſatis eſt ſubdi, that as much as was neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for inſtruction might be tould him concerning the contrary, Iudgement of the Church. S. Auſten</hi> cometh not to touch in the leaſt word this ſecond demaund, vntill the end of his Book, and then he cuts him of thus; <hi>It is ſuperuouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded (what you expected to be tould by mee) what the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church iudgeth againſt all theſe ſeeing that for this end</hi> (of having as much inſtruction as it is neceſſary) <hi>it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to know that the Catholick Church is of a contrary iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement to all theſe. Therefore every Chriſtian Catholick ought not to beleeve theſe things.</hi> Behould here the Iudgement of the Church, ſo much eſteemed, that wee <hi>have as much as is ſufficient for our inſtruction</hi> to auoid any opinion, when wee do but know <hi>that the Church iudgeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary:</hi> and to deſire <hi>to know more, is ſuperfluous;</hi> for <hi>this alone is enough to

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the iudgement of the Church. Could any Pope in thoſe our dayes have ſpoaken more Papiſtically? If you were to make a Catalogue of groſſe errours, and errours incurable, you would put this down in capitall letters.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let this then be <hi>the firſt authority</hi> of <hi>S.

Read then <hi>Sixtly S.

Thus then he writeth <hi>de Vnitate fidei</hi> C. 19. <hi>Let now an Hereticke ſay vnto mee, how do you admitt of mee into your Communion?</hi> (he ſpeaketh of ſuch an one as

But I pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how clear it is by <hi>S. Auſtens</hi> words that he gives an abſolute vniverſall reaſon, why, at the very writing of this diſcourſe, he received the Ghoſpel for Gods true word, ſo moved therevnto by the authority of the Church that were it not for her authority, he would not beleeve the Ghoſpel to be the word of God. If he ſhould only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve tould the Manicheans, what he had done at his firſt converſion occaſionally vpon a ground; which ground now he himſelfe thought vnſufficient, for ſuch an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſent, he had given them no kind of ſatisfaction; Neither could he have vrged them ſtill (as he doth) that he, in reiecting Manicheans muſt needs rely (as vpon ſure ground) on the ſame authority vpon which he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying was moſt groundedly induced to give credit to the Scripture. The truth then is, that <hi>S. Auſten</hi> tould them; that neither infidels could beleeve them (they only citing Ghoſpel;) nor Catholickes could beleeve them, becauſe they only cited that Ghoſpel againſt the Church, which he himſelfe with all Catholickes beleeved only to be true Ghoſpel for the authority of the Church. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in him; <hi>Why should not I</hi> (now at the writing of theſe) <hi>obey them</hi> (the Prelates of the Church) <hi>ſaying vnto mee, Do not obey Manicheus to whom I obeyed, ſaying beleeve the Ghoſpel.</hi> (Note here that he tells you he had ſo good a ground for what he did, that even now this motive, as an invincible motive, prevaileth with him: for he ſtill makes it good thus; <hi>Chooſe which you pleaſe.

the Catholickes; they admonish mee to give no credit to you. Wherefore beleeving them I cannot but disbeleeve you.

But if you ſay</hi> (to mee) <hi>you have rightly beleeved the Catholickes prayſing the Ghoſpel, but you have not rightly beleeved them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſing Manicheus; do you think mee ſo very a foole that, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beeing rendered for it, I will beleeve what you liſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeve what you liſt; except you do not only bidde mee beleeve what you will, but you alſo, moſt manifeſtly and evidently, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke mee know itt.

For if he had thought they could have miſled him in bidding him <hi>beleeue the Ghoſpel,</hi> he might have thought they could alſo miſlead him in bidding him <hi>not beleeve Manicheus.</hi> But you will ſay he thought they might bring manifeſt and evident demonſtrations for this aſt,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62436:175"/>
becauſe he inſinuateth that if they did ſo, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them, even when they ſaid <hi>he had reaſon to beleeve the Church prayſing the Ghoſpel, but not to beleeve it diſprayſing Manicheus.</hi> Whereas from that which wee hould infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, no reaſon ſhall remove vs. I anſwer, that he who ſayth to a man of an other Religion, I do not mean to paſſe to your Religion except you can ſhew mee, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and evident demonſtration that my Religion is falſe; doth he, by this ſaying intimate that he doth not give infallible aſſent to the Religion he is now of? For one may ſay to an Athieſt. <hi>I will dye for my beleefe in the Scripture, except you evidently can demonſtrate that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is falſe, and cannot be Gods worde.</hi> In theſe ſpeaches a mans meaning is, that vntill you can ſhew mee that you have done this (which I am ſure you cannot ſhew mee) you have no reaſon to find fault with mee for not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over vnto you. I prove this to be ſo here if I may but ſuppoſe (a thing moſt true) that <hi>S. Auſten</hi> did, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſent beleeve the Ghoſpel. For I pray obſerve if he ſpeaketh not of his intending to forſake his beleefe in the very Ghoſpel it ſelfe, if the Manicheans can ſhew by Scripture that any doctrine contrary to the beleefe of the Church can be true. So impoſſible did he hould it to ſhew the Church fallible in any one point. For even thus he ſayth; <hi>If perhaps in the Ghoſpel thou shalt be able to find any place that is manifeſt to prove Manicheus a true Apoſtle, then indeed you shall weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto mee the authority of the Catholickes bidding mee not beleeve thee</hi> (by ſhewing theyr authority is fallible.) Be pleaſed to reflect attentively on what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>This Authority</hi> (of the Catholickes) <hi>beeing weakened, now I cannot ſo much as beleeve the Ghoſpel.</hi> The word <hi>(now)</hi> ſheweth that at the very writing of this, he profeſſeth that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:62436:176"/>
if the Catholickes authority could, but in any one ſingle point, be ſhewed fallible, <hi>he cannot now beleeve the Ghoſpel;</hi> becauſe ſayth he, <hi>by thoſe Catholickes, I had beleeved the Ghoſpel,</hi> whom you now have in one point ſhewed fallible. Here ſome of our adverſaries catch hould on thoſe words <hi>becauſe by thoſe Catholickes, I had beleeved;</hi> whereas, ſay they, If he had meant theyr authority had been the Cauſe of his beleefe, he ſhould not have vſed the particles, <hi>Per, by,</hi> or <hi>throuh,</hi> but the particle <hi>Propter</hi> for. A weak objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for how often in Scripture doth this particle, <hi>By,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the true Cauſe vpon which, and only which men beleeved infallibly, as all did firſt <hi>by or through</hi> the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So.

Hebr:</hi> 6.18. Weaker then this is an other cavel that; <hi>S. Auſten</hi> could not eſteem the Church infallible, becauſe for a cleare place in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he would have denied her infallibility: For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this fond cavelling reaſon he ſhould have alſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the Scripture fallible, becauſe he likewiſe ſayth; <hi>the Catholiques authority beeing weakened, now I cannot ſo much as beleeve the Ghoſpel.</hi> The truth then is that he ſpeaketh with an Heretike denying the Churches infallibility, and diſputing againſt it out of Scripture; Wherefore he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth iuſt with him, as wee vſe to ſpeake with you, doing the like; that is, he telleth him only what ſhould happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if his impoſſibilities were ſhewed to be realities. And firſt he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:62436:176"/>
ſayth, that vnleſſe his open falſities can be demonſtrated out of the true word of God, (which is one impoſſibility) he would not beleeve them. Secondly he, even after the performance of this impoſſibility tells him, he hath yet an other anſwer, to witt, that he will neither beleeve him ſpeaking that, which he could ſhew to be clear Ghoſpel, neither would he beleeve the Church any more, becauſe ſhee had taught him to beleeve that to be Gods true word, which notwithſtanding did beare clear witnes to that, which ſhee taught to be a Lye: whence he, ſeeing her in one point fallible, would never rely on her ſo as to beleeve the Scripture vpon her authority, as then he did. You ſhall ſee how clearly he ſayth this; <hi>Wherefore</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>if in the Goſpel no manifeſt place be found concerning the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship af Manicheus, I will rather beleeve the Catholiques then thee: but if thou shalt read mee out of the Ghoſpel any place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly for Manicheus, I will neither beleeve them, nor thee. I will not beleeve them, becauſe they have lyed vnto mee concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thee</hi> (this one Lye ſhewing theyr Church to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;) <hi>Neither will I beleeve thee</hi> (even citing clear Scripture, as thou calleſt it) <hi>becauſe thou citeſt to mee that Scripture to which I gave credit by thoſe who have lyed vnto mee.</hi> Which words be perfect non-ſenſe without you ſay the Scripture in <hi>S. Auſtens</hi> opinion loſeth (in order to vs) her infallibility, if the Catholique Church can tell one lie: For in that caſe <hi>S. Auſten</hi> ſayth, he would forſake both Church and Scripture alſo, if any clear place in Scripture ſhould ſay <hi>Manicheus was a true Apoſtle.</hi> And he ſayth that for that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and vpon that ground be would forſake Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was that Scripture, which he only held to be ſo, by the authority of the Catholique Church, which now he had taken in one lye. But for all this, ſayth he, <hi>God for <pb n="434" facs="tcp:62436:177"/>
bidd I should not beleeve the Ghoſpel</hi> for thou canſt not bring any thing to make mee beleeve either the Church, or that which is commended for Gods word by the Church to be contrary to truth. <hi>For even beleeving the Ghoſpel I do not find how I can beleeve thee,</hi> there beeing in the Ghoſpel nothing for thee. And then he ſheweth, how clearly he findes the Acts of the Apoſtles to be againſt them: <hi>Which book</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>it is neceſſary for mee to beleeve if I do beleeve the Ghoſpel.</hi> Note <hi>firſt</hi> how he ſpeaketh of the beliefe he had now at the very writing of theſe ſaying, that he muſt beleeve this Book which is a Book rejected by the Manicheans. Whence it is manifeſt that he ſpeaketh of himſelfe as now a Catholique and ſuch a Catholique as received only ſuch bookes for Gods true word, as the Church recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him for ſuch; houlding alſo her recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſure, that ſhee could not faile in recommending any one booke for Gods word, which was not of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be held ſo, meerly vpon her recommendation; For thus he proveth that it was then neceſſary for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this Book (of the Acts of the Apoſtles which the Manicheans held to be no Scripture) if he beleeveth the Ghoſpel, <hi>Becauſe the Catholique Authority</hi> (of the Church) <hi>doth in like manner commend both Scriptures vnto mee,</hi> to witt as well the Acts, as the four Ghoſpels; for indeed it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thoſe who beleeve the Church fallible to beleeve her only when they think fitting: whereas thoſe who with <hi>S. Auſten</hi> beleeve her infallible, muſt needs ſpeake as he doth, that beeing the Church propoſeth this to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, as well as that, it is neceſſary for mee to beleeve this on her Authority as well as that.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Muſt now take away from our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries theyr laſt ſhift, which is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though S. <hi>Auſten</hi> and ſo many other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeak ſo often of the infallibility of the Traditions of the Church, and of the Councels, of the Church, and of the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in generall; yet, ſay they, what is this to the Roman Church, more then to the Engliſh which is a part of the Catholique as well as the Roman; ſhee only beeing a part and not the whole Catholique Church? I anſwer, that when wee ſay the Church is infallible, wee ſpeake, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity vſeth to ſpeak of the Church: that is, wee ſpeak of it, as of a flock adhering to theyr true Head-Paſtour; and conſequently wee ſpeake of the Church of Rome in this ſenſe, as ſhee is a Church Catholique, that is vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally comprehending all the ſheep of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> living in any nation though never ſo farre from Rome, yet joyned in communion to the Biſhop of Rome, as to her Head-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour: For thus the Roman Church, as comprehending
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:62436:178"/>
all Churches vnited to her Communion, cannot be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any time ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to have differed in doctrine from what the vniverſall Church ever taught, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: If therefore the vniverſall Church, following Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be, by the guidance of the ſame Tradition infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conducted, according to the opinion of the Fathers; the Roman Church, ever, treading the very ſelfe ſame ſtepps, muſt needs have proceeded as infallibly. Again, if the Church repreſentative be infallibly guided by the Holy Ghoſt, as I have proved, the ſelfe ſame muſt needs be true of the Roman Church, who ever was joyned in Communion and vnity of Doctrine with every lawfull generall Councel which hath been from <hi>Chriſts</hi> time to this. For it is ſo notorious, that our adverſaries cannot deny it, that the Biſhop of Rome either by him ſelfe, or by his Legates in his name, hath preſided in euery ſuch Councel, and ſubſcribed vnto it in the very firſt and cheefe place, or at leaſt he did ſend his confirmation and ratification of all the acts thereof. Her doctrine hath then alwaies agreed with all Lawfull Councels: If theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees be infallible Rules, as I have proued, then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Churches doctrine, euer ruled by them, is infallible. And the ſame Fathers who ſay the doctrine agreeing with Councels is infallible, alſo by manifeſt conſequence ſay, that the doctrine of the Roman Church is infallible. This beeing ſo notorious, no wonder if the Fathers many times promiſcuouſly ſpeake in the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and of the Church in generall, and take the one for the other, making no diſtinction at all. And this they doe both for the reaſons before ſayd, as alſo becauſe by the very name of the Church they vnderſtood the flock of <hi>Chriſt</hi> governed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:62436:178"/>

That which is for my preſent intent, is to ſhew that the Fathers, and why the Fathers, do take the name of <hi>the Church</hi> promiscuouſly for <hi>the Roman Church,</hi> though they do not name her by that name; becauſe it was ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that by the name of the Church they ment no other thing then <hi>Chriſts</hi> flock vnder theyr true Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard the Biſhop of Rome: And when it is once notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to the hearers what is ment by ſuch a word, the vſe of it is ſufficiently determinate. So here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland when with one an other wee ſay the Parliament did decree or examin ſuch a thing, wee are known no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly to ſpeak of the Engliſh Parliament; Though the word <hi>Parliament</hi> be as indifferent to ſignify the French Parliament, eſpecially if ſpoaken by French to French in the midle of France, as I have further declared <hi>Sect:</hi> 7. towards the end. I note alſo that all that I here in the laſt Sections cited out of the Fathers for the infallibility of the Church in her Traditions and Councels, muſt needs be ſpoaken of no other Church then of ſuch an one as did not diſclaime from infallibility; But all Churches, but the Roman, diſclaimed from infallibility; Therefore they taught no other church but the Roman to be infallible. If you ask why they muſt needs teach no Church to be infallible which diſclaimed from beeing ſo, I have given you a moſt evident reaſon thereof <hi>Sect:</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This note ſheweth that the Fathers muſt needs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, in thoſe ſayings of theyrs concerning infallibility, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Roman Church and could vnderſtand no other differing from her. But indeed (as I have ſaid) theyr very vulgar phraſe of Catholique Church, was known then to be applied to the Roman, taken in the ſenſe wee ſpoak of. Hence that ould <hi>Arian Iocundus</hi> ſayd to King

Peter.</hi> If a <hi>S. Hierom</hi> will ſignify a <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of Rome, he will do it by calling him, <hi>The Rector of the Houſe of God, which is the Church the Pillar and Foundation of truth.</hi> If a S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> or his Brother, be to picke out among Schiſmatikes a Biſhop who is a true member of the Catholick Church, he will do it by asking, <hi>whether he agrees with the Catholick Bishop:</hi> And he will tell you that in plain tearmes by that name he meanes <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi> And if a <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> be to ſpeak of a <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of the Roman Church, he will explicate him ſelfe
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:62436:180"/>
in current language, by calling <hi>him Bishop of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church,</hi> he beeing notoriouſly known to be that <hi>one Bishop which muſt be at all times in the Church,</hi> and <hi>no man can confide that he is in the Catholique Church who forſaketh the Chayre of S.

Peter, for on this Apoſtolicall ſeat Chriſt hath built the vniverſall Church</hi> as the moſt ancient <hi>Anacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hath tould you. Hence a S. <hi>Auſten (Epiſt:</hi> 162.) will tell Cecilian, that he needs not fear the conſpiring mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of African Biſhops as long as he communicated with <hi>Melchiades</hi> the Pope. Hence <hi>Optatus l.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Perme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian:</hi> will thruſt the Donatiſts out of the number of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, <hi>becauſe they communicated not with the Roman Church:</hi> and he himſelfe will adhere to <hi>Sericius</hi> the Pope <hi>to whom all the world was vnited.</hi> All the world then were Papiſts; and thoſe counted Heretikes who refuſed to be ſo. And in this ſenſe not to be a Papiſt, that is not to be one vnited <hi>in Communion</hi> to the Pope, was the ſelfe ſame as not to be Catholick; for all the Catholique world was vnited to the Pope or Head-paſtour of <hi>Chriſts</hi> flock.</p>

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:62436:182"/>
his own prejudice againſt the Churchs infallibility, which ſtands in his light, then any ſolid reaſon; I will alledge an objection or two, which poor weake human reaſon, moueth againſt the divine infallibility of all that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in vndoubted Scripture. Wee need not go farre to find theſe objections. Even in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Ghoſpel I find a difficulty ſo great, that though I haue (as I fully thinke) moſt carefully ſought ſatisfaction concerning it, in thirty or more of the beſt interpreters, yet I could find no anſwer halfe ſo ſatisfactory, as I, with my poore ability, hope to give to the very ſtrongeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that I could ever yet ſee made againſt the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church, taking the Church in the ſence which I explicated <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. The objection is this, which you may touch with your fingers. It is ſaid <hi>Mat:</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>All the generations from</hi> Abraham <hi>to</hi> David <hi>are fourteene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and from</hi> David <hi>vntill the carrying a way into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon are fourteene generations: and from the carrying a way into Babilon vnto</hi> Chriſt <hi>are fourteene generations.</hi> This is the infallible Text. Now take your fingers, and count with as great infallibility, as you can count, fourteene names ſet down in fayre print before your eyes. In the firſt fourteene you will find <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the firſt and <hi>David</hi> to be the laſt. Theſe you muſt not count over again in the ſecond fourteene. So that <hi>Salomon</hi> is the firſt of the ſecond fourteene, and <hi>Iechonias</hi> is the laſt; and as <hi>David</hi> was not to be counted in the ſecond fourteene, becauſe he was already once counted in the firſt, ſo alſo <hi>Iechonias</hi> muſt not be counted once more in the third fourteen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath been once before counted in the ſecond fourteene; whence it followeth that the firſt in the third fourteene is <hi>Salathiel</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Iechonias,</hi> and the laſt
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:62436:183"/>
muſt needs be <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, ſo that you muſt find twelve more generations between <hi>Salathiel</hi> the firſt and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the laſt, or elſe (ſayth human reaſon) infallibly you have not fourteen generations as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, you have. It is a ſmal labour for you to ſee whether you have twelue more, or no? Lay every ſeverall finger vpon every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall name, and if you have tenne fingers two names muſt remaine vntouched, or elſe you will not have twelue. I touched my thumbe vpon the name of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> whom I have proved to be the firſt of the laſt fourteen, then I touched the name of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> with my fore-finger, and thus having touched all my tenne fingers at the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawing names, I could not poſſibly ſee any more names to touch but the name of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> When reaſon tould mee that ſeemed to the very eye to be a demonſtration that <hi>Salathiel,</hi> who was the firſt of this laſt fourteene having but eleven more following him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> could not (with <hi>Chriſt</hi>) make vp the laſt fourteen. How then, if this be infallibly true, cometh that alſo to be infallibly true which <hi>S. Matthew</hi> ſayth contrary to this, calling theſe laſt thirteen generations as clearly fourteene as he called the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again <hi>S. Luke</hi> ſetting down the genealogy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayth <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 35: 36. <hi>Salah which was the ſone of Cainan which</hi> (Cainan) <hi>was the Sonne of Arphaxad.</hi> And all the Greek Copies of the new teſtament read thus, conformable to all the Greek Copies of the ould teſtament <hi>Gen:</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 12. Yet if you turne to this place in Geneſis, tranſlated faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by our vulgar, and your owne Bible, you ſhall not finde that <hi>Cainan</hi> was the Sonne of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> as <hi>S Luke</hi> ſayth, but you ſhall finde theſe words; <hi>And Arphaxad lived five and thirty yeares and begot Salah</hi> where as this <hi>Salah,</hi> was
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:62436:183"/>
the Sonne of <hi>Cainan</hi> according to <hi>S. Luke</hi> and not the Sonne of <hi>Arphaxad.</hi> If you ſay this <hi>Salah</hi> was <hi>Arphaxads</hi> Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne becauſe <hi>Arphaxad</hi> was his grand-father I pray note that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> is ſayd to have begot him, when he was <hi>five and thirty years ould,</hi> whereas if you mark, even that Chapter of Geneſis, you ſhall ſee no one there mentioned who had a Sonne before thirty years ould; for as in thoſe dayes they lived very long, ſo it was long before they vſed then to marry. Again there is yet a farre greater difficulty that the Greek Copie of the ould teſtament, which <hi>S. Luke</hi> followed, readeth thus; <hi>And Arphaxad lived five and thirty yeares and begat Cainan,</hi> ſo that, if <hi>Arphaxad</hi> were Grand father to <hi>Salah</hi> becauſe he begot his, father <hi>Cainan,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he himſelfe <hi>was five and thirty yeares ould</hi> (in which year of his age your Bible and ours ſay he begat <hi>Salah</hi>) thus <hi>Salah</hi> his gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d child a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Caina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> his Father muſt be born the ſame year, which, ſayth reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is infallibly falſe. Now if you ſay <hi>Caina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> is to be omitted according to ſome greek Copies in the ould teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t yet what will you ſay to all the Copies of the new teſtament which moſt vnanimouſly put him down. Heere venerable <hi>Bede</hi> profeſſeth himſelfe to admire that which his dulnes cannot vnderſtand. And indeed I think no man vnderſtands it. And Reaſon is more gravelled and quite non-pluſſed at an other contradiction, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to her vnavoidable. Turne in your Bible to the 2. Kings <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 26. There you read <hi>Two and twenty yeers ould was Ahazia when he began to reigne and he reigned one year in Ieruſalem, and his Mothers name was Athaliath.</hi> Now turne to Chron: 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 2. And ſee if a very different ſtory be not alſo true Scripture. For thus you ſhall read, <hi>Forty and two yeares ould was Ahazia when he began to reigne and he reigned one year in Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Mothers name was Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liath.</hi>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:62436:184"/>
Againſt the infallibility then of Scripture reaſon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth her ſelfe to have this infallible demonſtration: No one is infallible in ſpeach who ſpeaketh two things quite contrary one to an other; but theſe two ſpeaches be quite contrary, when of the ſame man one affirmeth. <hi>He began to reigne when he was two and twenty year ould</hi> and an other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mes <hi>that he was fourty two yeers ould;</hi> Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not infallible in ſpeech.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here by the way reflect (deer reader) how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively falſe it is which our adverſaries ſay, that by the only knowledge of Scripture a man may clearly be inſtructed in all fundamentall or neceſſary points: now I aske, whether any point be with you more fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall or more neceſſary then this; <hi>The Scripture is infallible?</hi> But this point is ſo farre from beeing clearly deduced out of the reading of the Scripture, that he, who ſhall read theſe three places, ſhall ſee with his eyes that theſe places alone make this verity more obſcure then any place of Scripture makes the contrary evident; For reaſon, left to her ſelfe, will ſooner ſhift off any place you can cite for the evidence of the Scriptures infallibility, then you ſhall be able to ſhif off the places cited. I do not put the anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to thoſe three places, that the reader may, by his own experience, ſee how true it is that all that concerns nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary points is not clear in Scripture; for what point more neceſſary then that the Scripture is infallible, and what point hath ſuch vnanſwerable difficulty as theſe be? If you could but bring halfe ſo clear a demonſtration againſt the infallibility of the Church, how would you triumph? All that could be ſaid by vs would never ſatisfy you. And yet here you muſt be ſatisfied, or grant Scripture in it ſelfe not to be infallible. What fondnes then, for incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:62436:184"/>
weaker objections, to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out ſo perniciouſly againſt the infallibility of the Church. Note this and you will ſoone note your own prepoſterous dealing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Secondly I muſt ſet down here a note which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to good method, ſome might have expected in the beginning of this queſtion of infallibility; But had it been put down there, it might have been ſubject to have been forgotten before wee ſhould have come to make cheife vſe of it, which is to be done in this next Section. This ſecond note then is this, that my Reader muſt be made capable of what kind of infallibility wee ſpeak, when wee ſay; <hi>the Church, in her traditions, and definitions, is infallible;</hi> or that theſe traditions and definitions deliver infallible verities vnto vs. This point is learnedly declared by our learned Country man <hi>Bacon in analyſi fidei Diſp:</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. citing divers ſolid Devines for this doctrine. Wee ſay then, that our act of faith, by which wee beleeve the Church, propoſing any thing to vs by her Traditions or definitions, is infallible in this ſenſe; that this Act of faith is begot by ſuch cauſes as do ſecure it from all kind of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: ſo that the vnderſtanding, which is informed, or made knowing by this act, ought to adhere ſo ſtrongly to what ſuch an Act affirmeth to be true, that though an Angel from heaven ſhould ſay the contrary, this vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding would never be brought to aſſent to him. So firme adheſion floweth from an act ſecured ſo well from errour by the cauſes which did produce it, I ſay with great reflection that this vnderſtanding by this act is ſo affected that the party <hi>would not be brought</hi> by the preaching of an Angel to beleeve the contrary, and I did not ſay that <hi>it could not be brought.</hi> For though the nature of evident knowledge ſhewing that a thing is ſo maketh that the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:62436:185"/>
party <hi>cannot aſſent to the contrary;</hi> yet this infallible act of faith, only maketh a man ſo affected that <hi>he will not ceaſe from adhering</hi> ſo ſtrongly to what he beleeveth, as long as this act remayneth vnretracted. This firmenes of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſpringeth from the great value and eſteeme which wee put (deſervedly) vpon the cauſes moving him to this aſſent. And this is the true reaſon why you will by no meanes be brought to doubt of the infallibility of the Scripture by any ſtrong objection that your naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon maketh, when ſhee ſuggeſteth ſuch objections as I iuſt now framed Meere pertinaciouſnes alſo and a falſe fanſy of the value of the cauſes by which even Heretikes pretend to be moved to theyr errours, maketh many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe theyr lives, then forſake to ſtick cloſe to what they imagin to be Gods word: ſhall not then a prudent eſteeme, ſolidly grounded concerning the devine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity moving to the beleefe of theſe and theſe points, be able to make a man adhere ſo cloſely to them as I ſaid? when then my vnderſtanding hath Motives, though not wholy infallible, yet ſuch as cauſe a moſt prudent aſſent <hi>that God hath ſaid ſuch a thing;</hi> and this is made ſo eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly credible vnto mee, that in prudence I cannot think it to be otherwiſe, and Heaven, is alſo by moſt highly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſes, offered mee, if I will aſſent to this with that reſpect which is due to Gods word, and Hell on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is threatned vnto mee by moſt truly formidable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, if I will not aſſent to this verity as to a Verity affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God; am I not rather ſtark mad, then impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent only if I will not bend my vnderſtanding by force of my will to adhere with all its power, to this verity, as to a Verity affirmed by God, and eſteeme it as ſuch a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to be eſteemed. Wherefore, as it is a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:62436:185"/>
inpiety to ſuſpect that the very leaſt danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity can be in a thing affirmed by God; ſo, becauſe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I alledged make mee carry my ſelfe ſo towards that (which is thus propoſed to mee to beleeve) as towards a Verity teveled by God, the ſelfe ſame reaſons do make mee conſequently more willing to deny any naturall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I can have, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to give way to the entertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any ſuſpicion of fallibility in this which I have received as Gods own word, as indeed it is See <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>num:</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now that which I mainly inſiſt vpon is this, ſuch an infallibility of adheſion as this act is, cannot be lyable, or any way ſubject to vncertainty, no more then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of that man whome God had fully reſolved ſo to guide, and direct, in all that he ſhould ſay or write, that he would never permitt him to ſay or write, the leaſt falſity, although this Man never knew nor ſuſpected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to have this priviledge. Iuſt ſo, though, wee neither feel, nor by evidence know the infallibility of our aſſent, our act of aſſent will be infallible, if God really concurre vnto it by ſuch principles as are no way lyable to errour. All the difficulty then in proving this our aſſent to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, conſiſteth in this, whether or no wee can prove that God concurreth to this aſſent by ſuch principles as are no way lyable to errour? To prove this wee muſt prove that our aſſent hath for its object not only an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Revelation, but alſo a revelation certainly true, and not only true caſually (by our hitting by chaunce vpon ſuch an object as is truly revealed by God) but it muſt be of ſuch a nature that it cannot, in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances guide mee to aſſent to any thing but that which cannot but be truely revealed. This then I prove thus.
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:62436:186"/>
Although there might be imagined ſuch circumſtances in which God could let mee have all the motives which ſo powerfully move to beleeve that ſuch and ſuch a point is revealed by God, although this were not ſo; yet ſuppoſing that the divine Providence hath reſolved never to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt (in the circumſtances in which men now live) any falſity to be commended to our beleefe by ſo powerfull motives as theſe be to witt miracles, full report of millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and millions teaching vniformely the ſame points to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve been delivered down to them, by millions atteſting that they received them as delivered from the Apoſtles, and thus going vp vntill wee come to them who teſtify that with theyr own eares they heard all theſe points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them and did ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> work worlds of miracles in confirmation of them, that they did hear thoſe ſimple men reſute all Philoſophers, ſpeake all languages, tell the very ſecretes of the heart, foretell things to come without ever miſſing &amp;c. ſuppoſing I ſay that the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is reſolved never to lett any falſity cloake herſelfe with theſe powerfull motives, theſe motives muſt needs be the certain Liveries of truth, and that which cometh veſted in them, cannot be any thing but truth. And this houldeth good whether I be or be not aſſured, that the divine Providence is reſolved never to permitt any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to be thus recommended to vs. For it is not our kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that no falſity will ever be permitted by God to be thus recommended to vs, which is the cauſe why no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity can be thus recommended: but it is meerly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall will of God, determining to provide ſo for our ſure guidance to that end, for which he created vs, that hence he comes to reſolve not to permitt at any time, any falſity to be ſo powerfully recommended vnto vs as it
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:62436:186"/>
ſhould be by theſe Motives of Credibility which he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a part for his peculiar vſe of delivering the Verities of our faith vnto vs as wee ſet the vſe of our Scales a part for ratifying only ſuch things as wee intend to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg for our owne true deeds.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If you ask of mee, how I can prove that God hath reſolved never to permitt any falſity to be recommended by thoſe motives, by which the Verities of our faith are recommended? I anſwer that firſt, the motives, which re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>commended the verities of our faith, do convince that which is ſo recommended, to be morally certain: as the full report of all men from all parts of England make it morally certain that there is ſuch a Citty as London to thoſe who never came neer London by a hundred miles. How much then would it misbeſeeme the divine verity a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Goodnes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre to the making of a falſity ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible as it is credible to all men that there is ſuch a Cittie as Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don? But Secondly it would farre more misbeſeeme him to make no leſſe aſſured offers of Heaven to thoſe who would beleeve a Lie thus recommended, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Hell vnto them without they would imbrace ſuch a Lie, even for a verity revealed by God, which threats were as certaintly to be feared as London is certaintly to be beleeved to be in England by thoſe who have not ſeen London. Thirdly it is evident that God can impoſe an obligation vpon man to follow the true Religion as a meanes neceſſary to obteyn his Salvation, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">
                        <desc>…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may propoſe ſome Verities to be beleeved as devine and as things revealed by God: Now ſuppoſing our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and preſent condition, (I may bouldly ſay) either that beleefe which is recommended by ſuch motives as ours are, muſt be this true Religion, or you cannot aſſigne vnto
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:62436:187"/>
mee any other kind of beleefe, recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by any other kind of motives, which can make it ſeeme ſo credible to mee as our Religion, It is impoſſible that a meer lie ſhould be ſo much more credible then Gods true word, as our religion is abſolutely more credible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any falſe beleefe; for this would breed a notable diſparagement and diſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme of the devine Authority, making it of leſſe credit then a Lie. How can that God, who hath a ſerious will to oblige vs to imbrace that beleefe as deuine, which is the only true way appointed by him to lead vs to heaven, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve a will alſo directly deſtructive of this will? that is, how can he have a will to permitt the Lyes, oppoſit to what he would have vs beleeve, to be in all reaſon made more credible by the motives which recommend them, then thoſe Verities are which according to reaſon he would have vs embrace, not only for Verities, but for Verities affirmed by him; that is, for infallible Verities? So that you ſee at laſt wee have brought it to a plain contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay, that (ſuppoſing our nature and the preſent circumſtances appointed <hi>de facto,</hi> by the divine providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) our Religion recommended by the foreſaid motives ſhould be falſe in this preſent ſtate, whatſoever it might have been in ſome other ſtate, which God could have choſen if he would have had no providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning vs: to which providence I confeſſe nothing could oblige him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Supooſing then no more then what is evident both by Scripture and reaſon, that God is reſolved to have a providence over vs, and to bring vs to the end for which he made vs by the beleefe of ſeverall Verities which he hath revealed; it is impoſſible that as long as he hath this will, he ſhould not alſo have a will to recommend to our
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:62436:187"/>
beleefe theſe verities (which he would have vs beleeve) by ſuch motives, as no lye can come recommended by him as long as he ſtill intends to vſe this providence towards vs. The acts then of our faith are infallible, becauſe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (whether the party who beleeveth knoweth it or no) theſe acts proceed from ſuch cauſes as are vncapable (in theſe preſent circumſtances) of recommending any thing that is falſe: But they ſtill recommend that which is atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not by any apparent, but by a moſt true revelation made by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Apoſtles to the Church; which Church alſo is, by the like motives, recommended, as infallible, and wee evidently, by our very ſenſes, know what this Church certainly teacheth: whereas, though all which the Scripture ſaith bee infallible, yet wee have not only no infallibility, but even no very probable certainty of our vnderſtanding the Scripture in the true ſenſe in many neceſſary points, except it be by the inſtruction of the Church; as hath fully been ſhewed <hi>Sect:</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Now beſides theſe exterior principles of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by which I ſay wee beleeve with an infallible beleefe the articles of our faith, wee muſt here note that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe is never produced (even by thoſe who have the Habit of true faith) vnles it be by the ſupernaturall illumination of God, elevating vs to all that hath imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate relation to the Supernaturall ſtate of Heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whence <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth vs that in order to atteyne this high ſtate <hi>wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves but our ſufficiency is from</hi> God 2. Cor: 3.5. Every time that a true beleever exerciſeth an act of true faith, God, of his infinite goodnes, affordeth this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall light infuſing it vnto the vnderſtanding to eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te it, and inable it, to produce the ſupernaturall act of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:62436:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith. Yet when man hath not this ſupernaturall aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his act, he cannot tell, be he never ſo learned. This all may know, that God doth never give this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall help to beleeve any thing, which is not really delivered by a true revelation made to the Apoſtles, otherwiſe he might be ſaid to give ſupernaturall aid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a Lie.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Out of all this diſcourſe, that appeareth to be true, which wee moſt deſire to be noted, that our acts of faith may be moſt truely infallible and are proved to be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proceed from Cauſes ſo determining to that only which is true, that they cannot determin our aſſent to any falſity and that all this happeneth thus although wee cannot evidently know when wee beleeve infallibly.</p>

What you adde of <hi>Optatus</hi> and <hi>S.

                  <p n="3">3. Again you object <hi>S.

That then, which no more concerned the Romans then all the world was not in reaſon to be intimated to them in particular.

Your enſving diſcourſe (for as much as concerns our doctrine of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility) hath had its full anſwer in my laſt Section, by which you will ſee that when any thing is beleeved, which is not truely revealed, the Act of faith can never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and ſo no act of faith concerning Proteſtantiſme can be infallible. Neither are wee infallible becauſe the Acts of our faith are infallible, no more then all thoſe who beleeved <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe or his Apoſtles were infallible. They are indeed infallibly guided but if they leave off

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:62436:191"/>
was never preſent, and in the Councels kept in the Eaſt few Biſhops appeared from the weſt, and to the Councels kept in the weſt few Biſhops came commonly from the Eaſt. The practice of the Church (the beſt interpreter of divine Lawes) teaceth that it ſufficeth that all who can conveniently he called and ſummoned doe appear, and that ſuch a competent number appear and ſet in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as thoſe (who are aſſembled togeather with theyr head) judge ſufficient on the one ſide; and on the other ſide that thoſe who be not preſent, knowing well enough (as wee ſee by experience of the appearance made in Parliament how all men know how great or litle it is) thoſe I ſay knowing how great or litle the appearance of Biſhops is in the Councel, ſay nothing againſt it, but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently conſent to permitt them to proceed as a ſufficient Repreſentative of the Church and accordingly admitt of theyr Decrees when they are made.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. OB: 9. Whether it be a Lawfull Councel if all come not who are called. I have made my anſwer alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that it is ſufficient that a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t number cometh; that is a number approved for ſufficient by the Church in the manner I now expreſſed.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. OB: 10. Who muſt call the generall Councel? The Pope, or Chriſtian Kings and Emperours? And how ſhall I be aſſured which of them muſt? I anſwer that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident out of Scripture that there is no divine Inſtitution by which either Emperous Or Kings be aſſured to be ſtill found in the world; or that (when they have that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) they be, by divine inſtitution, inveſted with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to call Councels. Wee ſeek for this divine inſtitution. This wee will not admitt vntill it can be ſhewed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or tradition. The fact of calling ſheweth not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:62436:192"/>
inſtitution. Secondly as for the Prelates of the Church wee can ſhew divine inſtitution. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Bishops placed by the Holy Ghoſt over all the flock to feed or governe the Church of God.</hi> And 4. <hi>Ephe:</hi> Not Lay magiſtates but only eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall are ſaid to be <hi>given vs by Chriſt for the work of the miniſtery, for the edifying the Body of Chriſt, that hence forth wee may not be carried about with every wind of doctrin: &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly the Emperour is not by divine inſtitution Lord of the Chriſtian world no nor of any conſiderable part of it, wherefore ſeeing that a motive power is no motive power any further then it can or ought to be able to Move; the Emperiall power which neither can nor ought to move further then it reigneth, cannot conſequently command any further then his territory at the vttermoſt. The Power of the cheefe Paſtor of the vniverſall Church is coextended to the vniverſall Church. All Biſhops of the vniverſall Church beeing to be moved muſt be moved by ſuch a power as this is. If Emperours called councels; it was not by any Eccleſiaſticall calling (ſuch an one as the Pope called them by at the very ſelfe ſame time) but the Emperors calling, was only politicall, proceeding from a temporall power, ſubſerving to the Eccleſiaſticall, and not able to force them by cenſure in caſe of refuſing to come, as the Eccleſiaſticall power could, which power inplored the Emperiall aſſiſtance to concurre with her, only for the more effectuall executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Perhaps ſometimes Emperors might venture to call dependently of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſupreme Paſtor, which they preſumed would be eaſely obteyned in ſo iuſt neceſſities as then ſeemed to preſſe for a ſpeedy remedy. If Emperors or Kings were preſent in Councel, it was only by theyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and good Countenance to honor, encourage and
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:62436:192"/>
further the proceedings of the Councel, and not to paſſe theyr vote in points of beleefe.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. OB: 11. How farre be the Councells determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s infallible? Whether in matters of fact as well as faith? I anſwer that they be infallible only in matters of faith. Matters of fact have no ground for theyr having been done ſo, or not done ſo, either in Scripture of Tradition; Wherefore concerning matters of fact the Church rules her ſelfe by no former revelation, and ſhee pretends to no new Revelations, but only to declare clearly what ſhee finds to have before been revealed. The infallibility was thus promiſed to the Church <hi>He shall teach you all things and ſuggeſt all things whatſoever I ſhall ſay vnto you.</hi> Things of fact are ſaid and teſtified only by men therefore not obiects of faith.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. OB: 12. Whether in theſe matters of faith the Church be infallible in fundamentalls only? I anſwer that in all the Authorities which I cited for the infallibility of the Church out of Scripture <hi>Sect:</hi> 14. <hi>n.</hi> 3. &amp;c. and 15. I ſhewed that they are groundleſly reſtreyned to only fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls in the ſenſe you mean. The ſame was proved by my Reaſons <hi>Sect:</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. OB: 13. How ſhall I infallibly know what points are fundamentall what not? I anſwer This queſtion may poſe thoſe who will be reſtrayning the generall promiſes of infallible aſſiſtance made to the Church to fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points only; that is vnto they themſelves know not what. But to vs Catholikes all is fundamentall which is made appeare to be propoſed to vs by the Church as a Veritie revealed by God, whether it be in a matter more or leſſe importing of its own nature.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. OB: 14. How ſhall I know in time of Schiſme,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:62436:193"/>
when there be two Popes or more, which of theſe is <hi>S. Peters</hi> true Succeſſour? I anſwer that this queſtion, as expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by you, is put very vnskilfully. For you paſſe from arguing againſt the infallibility of a Pope, as defining with a Councel, to argue againſt thoſe Devines who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver not the Churches beleefe, but theyr private opinion to be that the Pope ſhould beheld infallible out of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncel; concerning which opinion, I have ſhewed it all ready to be impertinent to our purpoſe. Your Obiection againſt vs, ſhould be put thus. The Church (with vs) is held to be the Pope defining with a Councel, But in time of ſchiſmes, where there be more pretended Popes, wee do not aſſuredly know that he who defines with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncel is the true Pope, or Succeſſor of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> And then I anſwer thus, If before the calling and meeting of the Councel there be more then one pretending to be Popes, that he ſhall ever be eſteemed the right Pope, to whom the Prelates of the Church ſhall vnanimouſly obey when he calleth them to meete in a generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, and in this Councel to preſide over them. To have two ſuch Popes (as theſe are) at one time, is impoſſible. And this is the only time in which a Pope defineth with a Lawfull Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncel. What you ſay of Popes not defining in ſuch a Councel, is not our Caſe. Putt mee a Pope defining with a Lawfull Councel, and then prove him fallible if you can. Whether the Popes definitions out of a Councel be fallible or infallible, maketh nothing to this purpoſe. Only this is evident, if they be infallible out of a Councel, they be infallible in a Councel in all opinions. I adde with <hi>Bellarm: lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Concilijs cap.</hi> 19. that Although a Councel with out a Pope cannot define any article of faith, yet in time of Schiſme, it can iudge which is true
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:62436:193"/>
Pope, and provide the Church of a true Paſtor, if ſhee had none; who thus provided by the Councels authority; may diſſolve the Councel if he pleaſeth, or if he pleaſe to have them remeyn aſſembled, they remeyn ſo, now by his authority, and can define as well as other Councels called by the Pope. In that meeting in which the Pope was to be choſen, or declared the vndoubted Pope, the Prelates of the Church might, and ought to meete vpon theyr own authority and aſſemble them ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. OB: 15. Suppoſe all agree on the Pope and a generall Councel meet, how ſhall I be ſure that he, who is accounted Pope, is ſo indeed? for Simonie makes him none; and that he was not Simonicall is impoſſible for mee to know? and then you labour to prove that <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> was notoriouſly Simoniacall which maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our purpoſe: Neither followeth it from hence that thoſe, who, beeing made Cardinalls by him, came afterwards to be Popes, were no true Popes. For you are too ignorant to treat of theſe matters, if you know not that a man may be a true Pope, who never was a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall To that which is pertinent, I anſwer, that though he, whoſe election to the Popedome is Simonicall, may be depoſed, as having obteyned that dignity vnlawfully yet, as all Iuriſts ſay <hi>The Crown once obteyned ſupplieth all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> So I may farre better ſay, that this defect beeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, may be ſupplied ſo, that of an illegall Pope, he may be after ward made a Lawfull one. For in the Church diffuſive there is power to have this man Pope if they will; and that they will they teſtify when they obey his Summons calling all Biſhops to a Councel, and permitting him, as theyr head, to preſide, and as ſupreme Paſtour to define in the Councel. Laſtly
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:62436:194"/>
by the Churches, admiſſion of the Councel I know the Councel, and conſequently the Pope was as legall as is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. OB: 16. How ſhall I know that thoſe Biſhops who with the Pope make vp the Councel be Biſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. For no Biſhops, no Councel. Now if he, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned them, when he gave orders did not intend to give them thoſe orders (and whether he did or no God only knowes) then they be no Biſhops. I anſwer that If they be Biſhops I am bound to admitt theyr decrees, and as he ſhould ſinne damnably, who would not honor ſuch a man held by all men to be his true Father, becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to know that his Mother did not ly when ſhee ſaid ſo, or to know whether it be not the divel in his Fathers ſhape, ſo I ſhould ſinne damnably in not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, by due Obedience theſe to be true Fathers of Gods people who are eſteemed ſo by all the world vpon farre better ground then ſuch a man is eſteemed your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther For firſt thoſe who ordeyne Biſhops or Prieſts be for the moſt part men moſt eminent in the Church. How is it then morally poſſible, that many ſuch men ſhould iuſt bappen, in ſo many ſeverall places of the world, iuſt to be the Ordeyners of iuſt ſuch Biſhhops, as ſhould be in the Church iuſt at that time, (which commonly is not above once in a hundred yeares) when a Councel is called. Again there be more then three thouſand Biſhops at a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in the Church (as witneſſeth <hi>Alb: Ros: Rubric: ff. de ſtatu omnium</hi>) out of which number wee ſee that it is very rare for more then three hundred to be aſſembled at a Councel, which is but every tenth Biſhop, now morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible is it that iuſt every tenth Biſhop ſhould happen iuſt to be that Biſhop who goeth to the Councel from
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:62436:194"/>
this part of the world (where in an age no one Biſhop was ever heard of to be thus invalidly ordeyned) and that iuſt at the ſame time there ſhould come from an other part of the world (where ſuch an abominable ordination is as vnheard of as in this part) an other Biſhop, whoſe ill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe it was to be thus ordeyned And thus from a third, fourth fifth ſixt part of the worlde, iuſt ſuch Biſhops ſhould come in a number ſufficient to make the number of other true Biſhops vnſufficient for a true Councel. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is a thing farre more morally impoſſible then that the Common wealth of England ſhould ever happen to have a full Parliament of Knights and Burgheſſes freely choſen, to the number of three hundred who ſhould not only be all of them Baſtards; but alſo all of them called Iohn. This I prove evidently: becauſe to conferre holy orders or baptize without a due intention, is not only a Sinne moſt abominable and damnable, but it is ſuch a Sinne as bringeth with it neither pleaſure nor proffitt nor any thing which may the leaſt intice any ordinary man (much) leſſe Biſhops and Prieſts to committ a ſinne ſo hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo vnprofitable wherefore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Chriſts</hi> time to this I do not think that the moſt knowing man vpon earth doth know to produce ſix examples of the committing of this ſinne. But on the other ſide no man knoweth ſo litle, but he hath knowledge enough to tell him, with out any raſh iudgement, that it is an ordinary thing in every County and Citty of England to find divers known Baſtards, and that the number of the vnkown is tenne times as great. And again the name of Iohn is the moſt common of all names; wherefore conſidering the nature of things, it is farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all impoſſibility that many of theſe Baſtards ſhould be called by this name And theyr Baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſme
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:62436:195"/>
not beeing known, the election may fall vpon them in this County; and what happeneth in this County may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an other, and ſo in all at once. Weaker farre then this is your argument And yet how ſecure would all men think England from all miſery, if wee were all fully aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that no miſery ſhould fall vpon this Nation vntill wee did chaunce to have a free Parliament, conſiſting of three hundred men, of which every one ſhould be a Baſtard and every one called Iohn? It is great want of ſolidity in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement in ſo many ſharpe witted men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to eſteeme ſo much ſuch a weak argument. And this is true preſcinding from all ſpeciall providence of allmighty God over his Church; but the leaſt thought of that providence maketh this light obiection vaniſh into ſmoake, and togeather with it the next Obiection. For how eaſily could God putt itt effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly in the minds of true Biſhops to meete in a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t number and when I ſee the Church Vniverſall admit ſuch a Councel to be a true one I Hence know that it had a ſufficient number of true Biſhops.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. OB: 17. How ſhall I know that the Pope and Biſhops aſſembled are Chriſtians &amp;c. Here you diſcourſe iuſt as before and the ſame anſwer anſwereth you to the full. Yet for a further anſwer to both I will ſhew how wiſe your argument is by framing iuſt an other like to it thus. O Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s how doe you infallibly know that in theſe Sixte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ages ſince the Age of writing of the Bible the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in ſome one Age did not intice as many men as were ſufficient to corrupt the Bible for I cannot ſee but that the Divel might eaſely make ſo many promiſes farre more inticing then any ordinary motive which ſhould moue men to baptize a child in a falſe forme or with wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of due intention with ſuch promiſes then the diuel might
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:62436:195"/>
intice thoſe who did write out the Bible, to write falſe, iuſt in ſuch and ſuch places as he ſhould ſuggeſte to them ſo that in the ſpace of a few ages, the multitude of the falſe Copies made them paſſe for the only true ones; And how know wee infallibly that this might not have ben done much after that age in which the divel incited the Tyrants to force all Chriſtians to give vp theyr Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to be burnt, by which meanes the true Copies grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce, falſe ones might poſſibly be brought into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe by the malice of the divel as hath been ſaid. And this exemple defeateth alſo your next obiection. Doth the divine Providence Sleepe in this maner?</p>
                  <p n="21">21. OB: 18. How ſhall wee know certainly that theſe are the determinations of the Councel? falſe Canons may be foiſted in and falſe Copies may be vented. I anſwer that what hath, or hath not been decreed by a Councel, may as well, and farre better be known certeynly, then what hath been decreed by one of our Parliaments, For Councels be ſo much more notifyed to all, becauſe they be the Parliaments not of one, but of all Catholike natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſo theyr deeds are more publike. Now how intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a caveller were he in a Commonwealth, who ſhould plead the not obliging of Parliamentary decrees, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the impoſſibility to know for certeyn what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed? and which were the true Copies of the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees? You would petſwade vs that wee cannot be ſure of that of which wee ſee by dayly experience wee may be made as ſure as wee would wiſh. The decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are publikely read, in the Councel publikely ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſealed by the Councel The Originall of theſe ſubſcriptions carefully preſerved, the Copies firſt ſet forth before diverſe witneſſes are conferred with the Originall
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:62436:196"/>
with a publike teſtimony (as you may ſee at the end of any Bull) <hi>that it Agreeth with the Originall.</hi> Thoſe, who in great Number were preſent, at the making of the decrees do own them; no one in the Church diſclaimes from them and in caſe any ſhould ſatisfaction would preſently be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Our very adverſaryes write againſt vs for decreeing ſuch and ſuch things, The fact is never denyed, but ever defended. If in any preſſe, a falſe Copie ſhould be ſet forth you will have prohibition after prohibition, and penalty added to penalty, vntill thoſe Copies be ſuppreſſed; and all bookes would be noting, and notifying this forgery: As wee ſee in our Church by dayly experience in matters of leſſe conſequence, as in ſetting forth the decrees of Cardinals, the Deciſions of that Roman Court called the Rota, or any other thing of this nature. Theſe eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make every one know theſe decrees with an vnqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable credibility, which, when wee have, wee are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furniſhed (for as much as concerns the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the object to embrace with our will theſe decrees as proceeding from the Holy Ghoſt, and teaching Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties revealed by God, vpon which wee immoveably fix our vnderſtanding, and wee are reſolved by our will to fix it ſo firmely, becauſe (by Gods Grace) wee have a will to proceed prudently in ſo important an affaire as the ſalvation of our Soul to which Heaven is offered if ſhee will ſubmitt to beleeve what God thus reveeleth; And Hell is threatned if ſhee will not thus ſubmitt. And this offer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d threats be as prudently to be regarded as certain, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh men prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly belive that there is ſuch a cytty as Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Nothing then which is not moſt rationall is required of vs it beeing moſt manifeſtly made credible, that this is the true command of God Madde therefore is that Soul,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:62436:196"/>
which will not ſubmitt. See what I ſaid in the former Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the fifth number to the end. And alſo what I fully expreſſed <hi>Sect:</hi> 16. <hi>n:</hi> 6. For that which you adde of forging a Canon of the Councel of Nice I doubt not but you may twenty times have met with a ſatisfactory anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were there vnto. See <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Spondan: An:</hi> 419. <hi>n.</hi> 13. Tell mee do forged Scriptures make the true Bookes of Scripture to Become fallible?</p>
                  <p n="22">22. OB: 19. How ſhall I be aſſured of the meaning of the true decrees when I now know them? For lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men have been of contrary opinions about the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. I anſwer, that to eaſe your tender Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wee will permitt you not to give your aſſent to any thing, of which you are not in Conſcience manifeſtly perſwaded that this, and only this, is the true meaning of ſuch a Councel: ſo that you be ready prepared in mind and heart to ſubmitt to the true meaning, when you ſhall come manifeſtly to know it. To more then this wee preſſe no body: only let not people faine that they doe not know what they know, or eaſily may know if they will: you muſt obſerve that Councels vſe to be aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled againſt ſuch and ſuch known opinions of Sectaries: againſt theſe they frame theyr decrees ſo clearly, that the Sectaries themſelves cannot find impudency enough to deny theyr opinions to be clearly condemned, and the contrary clearly defined: Wherefore wee ſee by experience they never ſo much as offer to do this; But all theyr forces are bent to cry down and vilify the authority, by which they were condemned. Some other paſſages in Councels may be found to be of an ambiguous ſenſe, and vntill thoſe paſſages be by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick authority, further declared, wee hould no man an Heretike for not taking them in the ſenſe which ſome
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:62436:197"/>
men are moſt inclined to conceive them to be ſpoaken. Hence appeareth the great benefitt it is to have a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Iudge, to whom all that is doubtfull may be referred and a cleare declaration procured, as it is expreſly noted in the very end of the Councel of Trent.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. OB: 20. What neceſſity of an infallible Iudge at all? I anſwer firſt, who aſſured you that God would give no prerogatiue to his Church which is not preciſely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for her very preſeruation? <hi>D. Fern</hi> profeſſeth ſuch a Iudge would be of ſingular benefitt for the keeping of vnity in the Church, and the ending all Controverſies. See what I ſayd <hi>Sect:</hi> 18. <hi>n.</hi> 2. I have alſo ſhewed the great neceſſity of this Iudge <hi>Sect:</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 4. &amp;c. True it is during the moſt bloody perſecution of the firſt 300. yeares the Chriſtian world could not enioy this benefitt: But I pray note what <hi>S. Iſidor</hi> ſayth <hi>Praefat: in ſuam Canonum collectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi> where having obſerved what I now ſayd of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions hindering the keeping of Councels, he addeth that <hi>hence Chriſtianity was torne in to diverſe Hereſies, becauſe licenſe was not given to the Bishops to meet in Councels vntill the time of the foreſayd Emperour</hi> (Conſtantine:) And yet for the firſt three hundred yeares Tradition of all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary could not but bee ſo freſh as to make a farre leſſe neceſſity of Councels then afterward when Hereſies had ſo oppoſed the firſt Traditions. But an infinite number ſticking cloſe to thoſe traditions were not only ſaved, but were glorious Martyrs in thoſe firſt three Ages.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Thus having anſwered your twenty Queſtions pertinent to the point of Infallibility I come to give you ſatisfaction in an objection wholy impertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For it concernes not any article defined by our Church, but private opinions of ſome private divines in
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:62436:197"/>
our Church, whoſe opinions (though never ſo erroneous) ought not to hinder your converſion if you were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. Yet even in this I hope to give you ſatisfaction. Your objection then is <hi>P.</hi> 16. out of <hi>D. Taylor,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to prove our inconſiſtency with civil government, becauſe ſome of our Divines teach, that that which one or two or ſome few of our Doctours ſay is lawfull, may, in our judgements, be done without mortall ſinne: But not only one, but many of our Doctours ſay tis lawfull to murder or depoſe a ſupreme Magiſtrate that is guilty of Hereſy, or ſuſpected of it: therefore <hi>Cavete Principes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſionem,</hi> ſay you; but according to truer Logike you ſhould ſay <hi>Cavete Principes Hereſim.</hi> I anſwer firſt, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection maketh nothing againſt our faith, but againſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions of private Divines, which opinions he who will practice muſt expect publike execution, which is ſo terrible, that it ſecures Princes more then any preachers frighting them with feare of Sinne. Secondly I do nothing doubt but even thoſe Divines would ſo limitt, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traine theyr looſe opinion to ſuch peculiar circumſtances, as would preſently clear, even theyr opinion from beeing the leaſt inconſiſtent with the preſent government, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des our cheerfull willingnes to take any oath, and enter into any Bond, obliging vs to the loſſe of all that in this world can be loſt, if ever wee ſo much as attempt the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this opinion in practice, which cheerfull willingnes I am ſure you will find in any Roman Catholike frend you have or can have in England. But I dare boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly ſay, that thoſe very <hi>Doctors never</hi> intended to ſpeak of the lawfulnes of murdering an Hereticall King, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in a Country where that which they call Hereſy, did already over whelme the whole Nation. I ſay nothing
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:62436:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of theyr other many Reſtrictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. As that the Hereſy of ſuch a Prince if he lives will certainly ruin his country.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Roman Church having been proved to be our infallible Iudge, all vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are bound to ſubmitt to her Iudgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my firſt Queſtion I proved (<hi>n.</hi> 1.) that there muſt be ſome certain and aſſured meanes to end all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſies or doubts which either be or can be in Religion. And (<hi>n.</hi> 3.) I proved that all muſt needs agree in this, that our vnderſtanding muſt be bound, vnder pain of damnation, to ſubmitt it ſelfe to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Iudge or Rule appointed by God to decide all neceſſary controverſies. Now, becauſe all faith eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſiſteth in the inward vnderſtanding (which is the very ſeat of true or falſe faith) God, who looketh in to our interior Soule, exacteth to ſee in that a ready imbracing of that faith without which no Salvation is to be had: And therefore, as I ſaid, he ſhould not ſeriouſly deſire our Salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnleſſe hee deſired that wee interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould yield, full aſſent to this one, and only ſaving faith, of which faith the Apoſtle ſaid that <hi>with out it it was impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> and <hi>S. Mark, He who doth not beleeve shall be damned.</hi> A falſe faith, taking the beleefe of a lye for a divine verity can help to ſave no body. All then, to
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:62436:199"/>
pleaſe God, and to be ſaved muſt have true faith which eſſentially conſiſting in the interior Iudgement, God would have this Iudgement readily to ſubmitt to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or determination of that infallible Iudge which was appointed by him as the only meanes to bring vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to this one true faith. I earneſtly in treat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reade the proofe of all this in the place above cited And <hi>Sect.</hi> 16. <hi>n.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All this interior ſubmiſſion of vnderſtanding, to-be due even to all that is ſaid in the Bible, and that even vnder pain of damnation, will eaſily be granted by any Sectary, houlding the Bible to be that only Rule and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which God hath given every one, as the only meanes to bring him aſſuredly to the true faith: Wee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes do no leſſe readily then they, ſubmitt to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to Gods word: but from the beginning to the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond Queſtion, wee have brought a world of evident and moſt convincing reaſons; proving that the Scripture, by it ſelfe alone, cannot be the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes appointed vs by God to bring vs to the aſſured knowledge of the true Faith neceſſary to Salvation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it by it ſelfe alone, end and decide all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about ſuch matters of beleefe and practice as are wholy neceſſary to Salvation; This I have ſhewed in above four and twenty particular points: Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that God hath apointed ſome other meanes for our certain and aſſured guidance in all theſe things. This other meanes I have proved, through all my third queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be the infallible direction of the Church, and then I paſſed to ſhew at large (through all my fourth Queſtion) that this Church, whoſe direction is infallible is the Roman Church, taking the Roman Church as
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:62436:199"/>
conteyning all that whole flock of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſheepe adhering to the Biſhop of Rome, as to theyr head Paſtour, in what place of the world ſo ever they live. I have ſhewed the Traditions of this Church to be infallible. I have ſhewed the decrees or definitions ſet forth in any lawfull Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of this Church to be infallible. Nothing of this I have ſuppoſed, but every particular, here ſpecified, I largely proved: ſo that I do not here, without having firſt given full proof, Suppoſe this Roman Church to be infallible.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This then ſuppoſed; I do not ſee how our very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries (convinced of the former points) can deny that all ſubmiſſion, interior, and exterior, muſt of neceſſity be yielded to this Church, whoſe directions be infallible, and ſecured by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt from all kind of errour: for, on the one ſide, there cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the leaſt fear of falling into any errour, by following our guide, who is proved to be ſecured from leading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to errour, and on the other ſide, this ſecurity from errour, proceeding from the promiſed aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, given to the Church purpoſely to direct all her children, in all points of that faith which God exacteth of all to pleaſe him, and to work theyr Salvation by it; and this direction beeing alſo the only ſafe and ſecure meanes which he hath given vs to this end; it is manifeſt that wee ſinne damnably if wee refuſe to follow it. <hi>Firſt</hi> becauſe it is a damnable Sinne not to ſubmitt to that order of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which the devine providence hath by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and alſo his Sovereigne Authority appointed vnto all for theyr direction: For (as wee at large ſhewed out of <hi>S. Auſten Sect:</hi> 21. <hi>n.</hi> 5.) if God ſhould give a man Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to direct vs in ſuch points, vnto which he would
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:62436:200"/>
have all to conforme, he who ſhould refuſe to ſubmitt to the direction of this man, ſhould be guilty of damnable diſobedience, not ſo much towards this man, as towards God who gave that Commiſſion to this man: ſo God (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what hath been proued) having given Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Church to decide and determine all our Controverſies in faith, and to direct vs in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, as well in beleefe, as practice; to ſtand out againſt the Church, and not to ſubmitt to this order appointed by God, is a moſt damnable ſinne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary <hi>diſobedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly</hi> wee have no ſtricter obligation impoſed by the Law of <hi>Charity</hi> towards our own ſelves, then to procure that laſt end for which wee were cracted, to wit the eternall Salvation of our own Soules: Wee are ſure this cannot be done, but by pleaſing God, who is not pleaſed but by our profeſſion of that only one true faith, of which it is ſaid <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe</hi> God Hebr: 11.6. <hi>And he</hi> (who with this true faith) <hi>beleeveth not, shall be damned. Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 16. He then, who will not take paines and care to ſee himſelfe ſecurely ſetled in this true faith (ſo wholy neceſſary to Salvation) is damnably guilty of vncharitablenes towards his own Soul; whoſe greateſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d eternall good he neglecteth to procure, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to procure the o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly meanes of true faith, by which it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only be atteyned. And let no body ſay this Meanes is too hard to be procured by mee; for I am no ſcholler but a poor ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t creature. This will not excuſe you for God knew well enough, that the farr greater part of thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he created for eternall Salvation and obliged to work the ſame with feare and trembling, and for whom he did, ſhedding the Laſt droppe of his blood ſo to purchaſe a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:62436:200"/>
greater plenty of graces for them; this God, I ſay, knew well enought that the greater part of thoſe, for which he did and ſuffered ſo much, were poore ignorant people: and therefore he had been no earneſt Louer of Soules, if he had not ordeyned ſome meanes ſo eaſy, even to the ignorant, that they thereby, might effectually be brought to that true faith, which he ſo rigorouſly exacteth of all vnder pain of damnation. This meanes, and this only meanes, I have proved at large to be the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and direction of the Church, whoſe traditions and decrees in all points neceſſary are ſo inculcated by every preacher and Catechiſt of this Church, that it is impoſſible for any one, deſirous of inſtruction, to live in ignorance of them; impoſſible to live according to them and not to be ſaved. <hi>For this Commandement which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it farro of: It is not in Heaven, that thou shouldeſt ſay who shall go vp for vs to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and bring it down vnto vs, that wee may hear it, and do it. Neither is it beyond the Sea that thou shouldeſt ſay who shall go over the ſea for vs and bring it vnto vs, that wee may hear it, and do it. But the word is very nigh vnto thee. Deutr:</hi> 30.11. Wee exact not the knowledge of Greek, and Hebrew, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the vſe of neere twenty Rules more as I have ſhewed our adverſaries to do <hi>Sect:</hi> 7. <hi>n.</hi> 6. But wee exact only the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this ſo know direction of the Church <hi>A way ſo direct that no foole can erre in it.</hi> And wee having ſo groundedly ſeen that this is the direction given vs by God to follow, wee do not proceed blindly by following it with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but no blindnes is greater then in an vnkown way, through which of nececeſſity wee muſt paſſe at our eternall perill if wee miſſe to refuſe the following of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guide provided for vs and offered to vs in this
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:62436:201"/>
paſſage and rather to yeeld our ſelves over to a confeſſed fallible direction. What greater blindnes?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>D. Ferne</hi> indeed and Proteſtants diſcourſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the ſubmiſſion due to the Church; but it is vpon the falſe ſuppoſition that Shee is fallible, without they mean to diſcours only of theyr own Church, and then they may truely ſuppoſe her as fallible as they pleaſe: and ſhee beeing ſo fallible they moſt vnreaſonably are ſtill exacting of vs even by moſt rigorous ſequeſtration of all our eſtates, ad by what other penalties they think fitt, to leave that Church which wee ſo groundedly hould to be the only infallible guide appointed vs by God himſelfe, as the only meanes to direct vs ſecurely to our eternall Salvation a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to yeeld exteriour conformity to theyr own new moulded Church, which they all confeſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to be fallible: which is to ſay, you muſt be vndone in your eſtate, without you conforme your ſelves to that new reformation of ours, which <hi>perhaps</hi> is true. For wee do not challenge infallible truth to what wee teach, wee beeing fallible men, and our interpretations of Gods word beeing only fallible; Yet infallibly wee will vndo you, if you will not follow vs: and yet if you doe follow vs <hi>perhaps</hi> you may be vndone eternally; for wee cannot ſay that our Church is infallible in what ſhee teacheth contrary to yours. Shee may therefore deceave you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a ly for a devine Verity: For you muſt be forced to imbrace a doctrine deduced by fallible interpretations out of Scripture which Interpretations the far greater and the far learnedner part of this preſent age rejects as Hereticall and which as ſuch were rejected by almoſt all viſible Chriſtianity for this laſt thouſand years, and which will perhaps ſhortly be rejected by vs. For it is ordinary
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:62436:201"/>
with vs (I ſpeak what truly Proteſtants may ſpeak) to reject that to day which yeſterday wee cryed vp for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Verity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now all this beeing ſo truly ſpoaken I do not ſee what needs more to be ſpoaken to vindicate and iuſtify our moſt juſt Recuſancy in refuſing to ſubmitt to ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous proceedings of men when they, providing vs no better ſecurity enforce vs to refuſe due ſubmiſſion to that infallible direction of the Holy Catholik Church moſt orderly appointed by God to bring vs ſecurely to that end for which he made vs, to which God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy vouch ſafe to bring vs all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And thus having ended what I had to ſay of this moſt important matter I muſt crave my Readers pardon for enlarging my ſelfe ſo fuſely For I am wholy of the mind of that dear freind of <hi>S.
